The input of the sub-goal validation function should consist of the 3d position of the sub-goal related objects.

The output of the sub-goal validation function should be a bool value indicating whether the sub-goal is achieved or not.

Some helpful tips for writing the sub-goal validation function code:
    (1) Write one validation function for each sub-goal
    (2) You may find it helpful to calculate the distance of objects
    (3) You may find it helpful to consider the actual size of the objects
    (4) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor

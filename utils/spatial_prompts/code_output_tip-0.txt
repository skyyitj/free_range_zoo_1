The input for the sub-goal validation function should include the 3D coordinates of the objects associated with the sub-goal.

The output of the sub-goal validation function should be a boolean value indicating whether the sub-goal has been accomplished.

Here are some useful suggestions for coding the sub-goal validation function:
(1) Create a separate validation function for each sub-goal.
(2) It may be beneficial to compute the distance between objects.
(3) Taking into account the actual dimensions of the objects might be advantageous.
(4) Ensure that each input variable's type is accurately defined; for instance, a float input variable should not be labeled as torch.Tensor.

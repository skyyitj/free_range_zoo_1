### Explanation:
1. **Distance Normalization:**  
   Distance from the agent to each fire location is normalized using an exponential decay function. Fires closer to the agent are given higher scores, facilitating faster response.

2. **Fire Intensity Normalization:**  
   Fires with higher intensity are treated as more critical, normalized using exponential scaling. This incentivizes agents to prioritize severe fires.

3. **Task Weight Incorporation:**  
   Priority weights (`fire_putout_weight`) for each fire task are directly incorporated, providing a mechanism to emphasize important tasks.

4. **Temperature Parameters:**  
   `distance_temp`, `intensity_temp`, and `weight_temp` are constants used to scale each score component. These parameters ensure that distance, intensity, and weights contribute comparably to the score.

5. **Score Aggregation:**  
   Scores from distance, intensity, and weights are averaged to produce an overall task score. Tasks with higher aggregate scores are prioritized.

6. **Task Selection:**  
   The fire task with the highest score is selected using `np.argmax`.

### Benefits:
- Balances proximity, severity, and prioritization effectively.
- Allows agents to adapt dynamically to the environment.
- Promotes strategic use of suppressant resources by focusing on high-priority fires.

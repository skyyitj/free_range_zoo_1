Here’s a potential implementation of the policy function that adheres to the wildfire suppression task rules and objectives, aiming to prioritize fires based on urgency and reward weights while factoring in the agent’s capacity:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    import numpy as np

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    task_scores = []

    # Temperature parameters for transformations
    intensity_temp = 0.5
    distance_temp = 1.0
    reward_temp = 1.5

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Distances between agent and fire location
        distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(agent_pos) - np.array(fire_pos[i]))
        
        # Normalize components
        fire_intensity_transformed = np.exp(fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temp)
        distance_transformed = np.exp(-distance / distance_temp)
        reward_weight_transformed = np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / reward_temp)

        # Compute score
        score = reward_weight_transformed * fire_intensity_transformed * distance_transformed

        # Penalize tasks if not enough suppressant to significantly reduce fire
        if agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num < fire_intensities[i]:
            score *= 0.5  # Reduce priority of tasks outside capability

        task_scores.append(score)

    # Select task with highest score
    best_task_idx = np.argmax(task_scores)
    return best_task_idx
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Component Transformations**:
   - Fire intensity is expanded exponentially (with temperature `intensity_temp`) to prioritize higher-intensity fires.
   - Distance scores are reduced exponentially (with temperature `distance_temp`) to prioritize closer fires.
   - Reward weights are treated with higher priority by applying an exponential transformation using `reward_temp`.

2. **Resource Feasibility**:
   - If the agent’s available suppressant multiplied by their reduction power cannot sufficiently reduce the fire intensity, the task is penalized to avoid wasting resources.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - Final score considers priority weights, fire intensity, and proximity, with respective transformations.

4. **Selection**:
   - The task with the highest score is selected, ensuring the agent focuses on the optimal task.

This policy accounts for critical factors like fire urgency, proximity, reward weights, and agent capability to strategically suppress fires.

Here's a balanced policy function that takes into account the agent's position, available suppressant resources, fire spread risks, and reward priorities to select the best task:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    import numpy as np

    # Initialize temperature parameters for score calculations
    distance_temp = 10.0  # Temperature for distance scaling
    intensity_temp = 0.5  # Temperature for fire intensity scaling
    weight_temp = 1.0     # Temperature for priority weight scaling

    # Helper function to calculate Manhattan distance between two points
    def manhattan_distance(pos1, pos2):
        return abs(pos1[0] - pos2[0]) + abs(pos1[1] - pos2[1])

    best_task_idx = 0  # Default to the first task
    highest_score = -float('inf')

    # Iterate through all fire tasks
    for i in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Fire position and properties
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[i]
        fire_level = fire_levels[i]
        fire_intensity = fire_intensities[i]
        fire_weight = fire_putout_weight[i]

        # Calculate distance between agent and fire
        distance = manhattan_distance(agent_pos, (fire_y, fire_x))

        # Calculate suppressant usage and remaining fire intensity
        suppressant_used = min(agent_suppressant_num, fire_intensity / agent_fire_reduction_power)
        remaining_fire = fire_intensity - suppressant_used * agent_fire_reduction_power

        # Penalty for high remaining fire (inducing fire spread risk)
        fire_spread_risk = max(remaining_fire, 0)

        # Normalize and transform individual components into a score
        distance_score = -np.exp(-distance / distance_temp)
        intensity_score = np.exp(-fire_intensity / intensity_temp)
        weight_score = np.exp(fire_weight / weight_temp)

        # Combine the scores (weight them to reflect priority order)
        score = weight_score + intensity_score - fire_spread_risk + distance_score

        # Update the best task based on the score
        if score > highest_score:
            best_task_idx = i
            highest_score = score

    return best_task_idx
```

### Policy Explanation:

1. **Distance Factor**:
   - The function calculates the Manhattan distance between the agent and each fire location.
   - A smaller distance is preferred, so we use `-np.exp(-distance / temperature)` to reward proximity non-linearly.

2. **Fire Intensity**:
   - The fire's intensity determines the challenge in tackling it.
   - Higher intensity locations are deprioritized unless critical, due to the agent's suppressant limitations. This is scaled with `np.exp(-fire_intensity / temperature)`.

3. **Remaining Fire and Spread Risk**:
   - The fire spread risk is approximated using the remaining fire after the agent's suppressant is applied.
   - Fires with higher potential spread risks are deprioritized unless the agent has sufficient suppressant to make an impact.

4. **Reward Weight**:
   - Fires with higher `fire_putout_weight` values are prioritized. These values are exponentiated to amplify the priority effect over other scores.

5. **Normalization**:
   - The score components are transformed using exponential scaling factors to normalize and amplify their effects.

6. **Task Selection**:
   - The fire with the highest combined score is selected. Scores balance fire weight, intensity, distance, and spread risk.

This policy intelligently allocates agents to fire locations while conserving resources, taking fire suppression priorities and environmental risks into account.

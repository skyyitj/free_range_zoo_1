Here is the wildfire suppression policy function designed according to the task rules. The function prioritizes fire suppression tasks considering agent capabilities, fire severity, proximity, and task reward weights, while ensuring resource-efficient decisions:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    import numpy as np

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []

    # Temperature parameters for transforming score components
    intensity_temp = 1.0
    distance_temp = 5.0
    suppression_temp = 1.0

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Calculate distance between agent and fire location
        fire_dist = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)

        # Transform fire intensity for scoring
        scaled_fire_intensity = np.exp(fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temp)

        # Transform distance for scoring (inverse relationship: closer distance is better)
        distance_score = np.exp(-fire_dist / distance_temp)

        # Check if the agent can effectively suppress the fire at this location
        max_suppressible_fire = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num
        suppressibility_score = (
            np.exp(min(max_suppressible_fire, fire_intensities[i]) / suppression_temp)
        )

        # Incorporate reward weight for prioritization
        reward_priority = fire_putout_weight[i]

        # Combine all factors into a single score
        total_score = (
            reward_priority * scaled_fire_intensity * distance_score * suppressibility_score
        )
        scores.append(total_score)

    # Choose the task with the highest score
    best_task_index = int(np.argmax(scores))
    return best_task_index
``` 

### Explanation of the Policy:
1. **Distance-Based Prioritization**: Fires closer to the agent are prioritized, as proximity minimizes travel delay and spreads containment efforts more effectively.

2. **Intensity Consideration**: Fires with higher intensity values are weighted more heavily, ensuring urgent suppression to prevent spread.

3. **Suppressibility**: The policy considers whether the agent has sufficient suppressant resources to meaningfully reduce the fire intensity. Fires that can be extinguished with available resources are given higher scores.

4. **Reward Weights**: Fire locations with higher priority weights are amplified in decision-making, guiding the agent toward higher-reward tasks.

5. **Normalization**: Distance and fire intensity scores are normalized using exponential transformations with adjustable temperature parameters for fine-tuning behavior.

### Key Components:
- **Temperature Parameters**: Intensity, distance, and suppression-related components feature dedicated temperature variables, allowing for the calibration of score components to a desired level of influence.

### Expected Behavior:
- The function assigns the agent to the fire task that optimally balances reward priority, fire intensity, proximity, and resource availability.

/opt/anaconda3/envs/three12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/nested/__init__.py:109: UserWarning: The PyTorch API of nested tensors is in prototype stage and will change in the near future. We recommend specifying layout=torch.jagged when constructing a nested tensor, as this layout receives active development, has better operator coverage, and works with torch.compile. (Triggered internally at /Users/runner/work/pytorch/pytorch/pytorch/aten/src/ATen/NestedTensorImpl.cpp:182.)

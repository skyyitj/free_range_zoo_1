Based on the provided description emphasizing resource management, fire dynamics, and reward structure, the implementation should consider:
1. Fire intensity at each location (`fire_levels` and `fire_intensities`).
2. The agent's suppressant reserves (`agent_suppressant_num`).
3. Distance between the agent and various fire locations to minimize time spent traveling which is a proxy for minimizing resource expenditure in transit.
4. The potential impact of assigning multiple agents to the same fire, which might indicate a need for coordination, which I'll simplify in this task.

Given these ideas, I'll develop a priority score based on:
- The potential reduction of fire damage if the agent attacks a specific fire (influence by `fire_levels` and potential reduction).
- Proximity from the agent to each fire (`euclidean distance`).
- `fire_putout_weight` to prioritize certain fires based on the given reward structure.

    fire_levels,
    fire_intensities,
    fire_putout_weight

    weight_temp = 1.0
    suppressant_temp = 0.1
    
    best_task = -1
    best_score = float('-inf')
    
    # Iterate over each fire task to compute scores based on fires
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        fy, fx = fire_pos[i]
        intensity = fire_intensities[i]
        level = fire_levels[i]
        weight = fire_putout_weight[i]
        
        # Euclidean distance from agent to the fire
        dist = np.sqrt((fy - agent_pos[0]) ** 2 + (fx - agent_pos[1]) ** 2)
        
        # Consider agent effectiveness - how much of the fire they could potentially suppress
        potential_suppression = min(agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num, level)
        fire_after_suppression = level - potential_suppression

        suppressant_score = np.exp(-potential_suppression * suppressant_temp)
        
        score = (
            distance_score * 
            suppression_score * 
            weight_score * 
            suppressant_score

            best_score = score

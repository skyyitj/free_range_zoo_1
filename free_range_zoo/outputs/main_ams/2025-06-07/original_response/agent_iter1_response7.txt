    ])
    
    # Calculate the effectiveness of agent fighting each fire
    # This is based on the amount of fire reduction power, suppressant available 
    # and the current intensity of the fire
    potential_impact = np.array([
        min(fire_intensities[i], agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num)
        for i in range(len(fire_intensities))
    ])
    
    # Adjust suppressant efficiency accounting for fire intensity
    # Bigger fire - more efficient use of suppressant
    suppressant_efficiency = potential_impact / (agent_supressant_num + 1e-6)  # Avoid zero division

    # Compute score for each fire based on various factors
    effectiveness_normalized = potential_impact / fire_intensities            # How effective the agent can be
    weight_effectiveness = fire_putout_weight * effectiveness_normalized      # Impact weighted by priority
    score = weight_effectiveness / (distances + 1)                            # Take into account distance
    
    # Factor in suppressant usage efficiency inversely
    suppressant_weight = -0.001  # Penalty weight for using more suppressant
    score += suppressant_weight * suppressant_efficiency
    
    # Select the fire with the maximum score
    selected_task_index = np.argmax(score)
    
    return selected_task_index
```
This refined policy now considers distance, potential impact on the fire based on the agent's capacities, efficiency of suppressant usage, and the prioritization weights for each task. Additionally, it introduces a balancing factor for suppressant usage to ensure agents use their resources wisely without exhaustively using them on lower-priority tasks. This should enhance performance, making the agents more effective and efficient in handling multiple fires.

This policy has enhanced the consideration for agent proximity to fires, suppressant availability, and prioritized tasks based on the combined necessity of urgent put-out capabilities and individual fire impact. By refining the scorings and weighs the benefits of attending a fire more judiciously, it expects to improve on fire control, resource usage efficiency, and overall operation success.

In this revised policy, the crucial improvements are:
1. **Improved Distance Calculation**: Using `np.linalg.norm` for vectorized and more efficient calculations.
2. **Advanced Suppression Modelling**: Considering how much the fire is reducible and optimizing for potential overkill to save resources.
3. **Safety Margin on Suppressant**: Added a safety threshold to prevent agents from using all suppressants unnecessarily.
4. **Balanced Weighting System**: More elaborate weighting system that balances the urgent reduction of fire, proximity, and efficient usage of fire suppressants.
5. **Logarithmic Scaling**: Employed to manage explosive scores due to disproportionally high values, ensuring a softer transition in priorities and emphasizing moderate resource use.
6. **Conditional Boost for Extinguishable Fires**: Special scoring for fires that can be completely extinguished, promoting complete termination where possible.

    agent_pos,

    ]

    # Normalize distances to prioritize nearby fires
    normalized_distances = 1 / (np.array(distances) + 0.001)  # Add a small value to avoid division by zero

    # Improved Use of Suppressant
    # Prevent total suppressant use from exceeding available amount
    max_suppressant_use = min(agent_suppressant_num, np.sum(fire_intensities) / agent_fire_reduction_power)

    # Calculate potential suppressant effect on each fire
    suppressant_per_fire = max_suppressant_use / len(fire_pos)
    potential_fire_reductions = suppressant_per_fire * agent_fire_reduction_power / np.array(fire_intensities)
    
    # Compute new potential fire levels after suppression
    new_fire_levels = np.array(fire_levels) - potential_fire_reductions

    # Normalize the new fire levels; goal is to prioritize fires that can be significantly reduced or put out
    normalized_new_fire_levels = 1 - (new_fire_levels.clip(min=0) / np.array(fire_levels))

    # Calculate how desperate a fire needs to be addressed based on current intensity
    fire_desperation = np.array(fire_levels) / np.max(fire_levels)
    
    # Calculate reward efficiency (reward per suppressant used)
    reward_efficiency = (np.array(fire_putout_weight) * normalized_new_fire_levels) / suppressant_per_fire

    # Combine all scores to determine which fire to target
    # Supplement: Incorporate distance, new fire level effectiveness, and reward efficiency
    scores = normalized_distances * reward_efficiency
    
    # Selection of the fire task with the highest score
    selected_task_index = np.argmax(scores)

    return selected_task_index
```

In the revised policy, the function considers:
- How close the fires are.
- The amount of suppressant each fire would need relative to the reward it offers.
- Prioritize fires based on the potential reduction in fire level.
- Calculate a composite score based on distance and reward efficiency.

This strategic balance should optimize reward efficiency, suppressant use, and effectively manage fire intensities, aiming to improve the performance metrics discussed.

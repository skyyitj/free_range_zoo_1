    # Calculate distances from agent to each fire task
    distances = np.array([np.sqrt((fp[0] - agent_pos[0])**2 + (fp[1] - agent_pos[1])**2) for fp in fire_pos])
    
    # Compute efficiencies, such as firepower (how much intensity can an agent reduce)
    firepower = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_supressant_num
    suppressant_efficiency = firepower / fire_intensities    # effectiveness of agent's current firepower
    
    # Calculate urgency, prioritizing the fires with higher levels but also consider balance
    urgency = (np.array(fire_levels) / max(fire_levels)) * fire_putout_weight
    
    # Improved prioritization: combination of how critical a fire is and how efficiently it can be handled
    scores = suppressant_efficiency * urgency
    
    # Normalize distances; smaller distances should lead to higher scores
    normalized_distances = 1 / (distances + 0.001)
    
    # Modify the total score by adding the effect of normalized distances on it.
    adjusted_scores = scores * normalized_distances
    
    # Return the index of the fire assignment with maximum score
    return int(np.argmax(adjusted_scores))
```
In this revised policy function, the following improvements and changes were made:
- Suppressant effectiveness is calculated explicitly using `firepower / fire_intensities` considering each fire's current intensity.
- Urgency of the fire is recalculated to use the fire levels, normalized by the maximum fire level, and multiplied by the fire weights for better-targeted response.
- Normalized distances are calculated to allow the agent to favor closer fires.
- Scores are adjusted based on the combination of suppressant efficiency, urgency, and normalized distances.
- Returned the index of the task as an integer to prevent any potential type issues.
With these modifications, the policy should now better balance between the effectiveness, urgency, necessity, and proximity of fires, leading to an optimized dispatch strategy for the agents.

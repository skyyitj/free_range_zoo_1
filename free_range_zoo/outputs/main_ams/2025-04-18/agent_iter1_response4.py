There are several aspects that we can improve from the previous policy.

First, the previous policy only considered the distance between the agent and the fire when scoring a fire. However, this does not take into account other nearby agents that could also be able to put out the fire. Therefore, we will refine the score definition by incorporating the number of agents near a fire.

Second, we will introduce a temperature parameter for the distance and fire intensity calculation. This will control the policy's sensitivity to the distance and fire intensity.

Finally, the previous policy did not consider the level of the fire. We will amend this by adding another term in the score calculation for the fire level. A larger fire level means more effort will be needed to put out the fire, so we should prioritize such fires.

Here is the revised policy function:

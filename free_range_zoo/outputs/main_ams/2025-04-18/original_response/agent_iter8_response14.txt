In this revised policy, we modify the `dist_temperature`, `suppressant_power_temperature` and `fire_level_temperature` to further optimize the policy. We increase the `dist_temperature` to represent giving the distance factor more importance. The `suppressant_power_temperature` is decreased to represent less importance given to suppressant power as an agent should not rely only on the suppressant power. The `fire_level_temperature` is also increased to represent more importance given to the fire level. 

A `fire_weight_temperature` is introduced to balance the intensity of the fire and resources available. The score calculation is also adjusted to incorporate the newly introduced variable. The new policy should improve the agents' performance in rapidly and effectively suppressing fires.

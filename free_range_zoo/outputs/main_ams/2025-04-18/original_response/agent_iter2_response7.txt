Based on the results and the metric values, it is noted that the "Average Fire Intensity Change" and "Average Suppressant Efficiency" are not satisfactory, indicating that the agents might not be efficiently using their fire suppressants or effectively reducing the fire intensity.

Taking these observations into account, I propose the following adjustments to the policy function.

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:
    # === Fire Task Selection Scoring ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):
        
        # Changes: Dist now also includes agent_fire_reduction_power as a factor and 
        # becomes a comprehensive indicator for distance, suppressant amount, and fire reduction power of the agent
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num*agent_fire_reduction_power)

        # Change: Redefine the suppressant_factor and how it is used in the score formula.
        # Now, it also considers fire's intensity, making it a composite multiplier for suppressant efficiency, fire intensity and agent's fire
        # reduction ability. This should decrease the "Average Fire Intensity Change" while increasing 
        # "Average Suppressant Efficiency".
        suppressant_factor = agent_suppressant_num * (agent_fire_reduction_power / fire_intensity)
        score = fire_weight * suppressant_factor - dist * fire_level

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

In this adapted version, the distance factor `dist` is adjusted to include not only distance and suppressant amount but also the fire reduction ability of the agent. Additionally, suppressant_factor is redefined to include the ratio of fire reduction power and fire intensity. These changes are aimed to improve the efficiency of suppressant use and the effectiveness of fire intensity reduction.

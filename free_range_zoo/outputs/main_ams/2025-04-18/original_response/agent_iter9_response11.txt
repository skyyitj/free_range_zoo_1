        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        agent_count = sum([((fire_position[0]-pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-pos[1])**2)**0.5 < 1.0 for pos in other_agents_pos])

        # Decrease score if too many agents are already handling a fire.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature) / (1 + agent_count)

```

In this new policy, we lower the weight on distance to encourage the spread of agent positions across the grid, helping to cover more fires quickly. Also, we increase the weight on fire level to encourage quick handling of smaller fires.

In addition, to deal with efficiency in handling fires, we have introduced a new factor, agent count, to the scoring criteria. This factor represents the number of agents already handling the fire. If a fire already has many agents handling it, this agent will be less likely to choose it, resulting in more efficient distribution of work amongst available agents.

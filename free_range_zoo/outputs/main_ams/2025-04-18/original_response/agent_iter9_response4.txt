        # Distance factor with higher weight

        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

In the updated policy, I have made the following changes:

- Increased the distance temperature to further prioritize nearby fires.
- Increased the suppressant power temperature to give more weight to the agent's suppressing power. This is to make them more likely to tackle high intensity fires.
- Further increased the fire level temperature to put even more emphasis on the task of putting out fires before they become too intensive. This change is aimed at reducing the burned out number.
  
The Revised policy is aiming to make the agent take a decision by prioritizing the fires based on the distance factor, the agent's firefighting capacity, and the intensity of the fire. The aim is to reduce burning number and burned-out number by tackling fires efficiently and quickly.

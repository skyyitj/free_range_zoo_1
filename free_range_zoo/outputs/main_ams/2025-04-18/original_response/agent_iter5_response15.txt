In this revised policy, we introduce separate temperature parameters for distance, suppressant usage, and the level of the fire to control these factors independently. We also utilize exponential functions to normalize these factors to a range between 0 and 1, and to further emphasize the differences, which helps to prioritize closer fires, lower intensity fires and fires at a higher level. By changing the functions and parameters, this revised policy is expected to bring better performance regarding the used suppressant, the number of putout fires and the final rewards.

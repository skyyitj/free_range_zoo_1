In the revised policy function, The agent calculates a score for each fire using a modified scoring function. The scoring function prioritizes the fires which are nearer, have a higher fire level and higher weight, and which the agent is capable of extinguishing with the suppressant it has in hand.
The policy also improves agent's fire suppressant efficiency by calculating the suppressant power based on the square of the available fire suppressant and the agent's fire reduction power. This helps the agent to more effectively extinguish the fires with the available resources thus potentially reducing the fire intensity change and the number of steps taken to complete the task.

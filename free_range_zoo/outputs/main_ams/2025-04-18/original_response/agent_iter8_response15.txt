    best_fire = None

    dist_temperature = 0.2  # Adjusted to put higher weight on distance.
    suppress_power_temperature = 0.01  # Adjusted to put less weight on suppressing power.
    fire_level_temperature = 0.8  # Adjusted to put significant importance on the fire level.

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor with higher weight
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with lower weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

In the new policy, the distance factor is given more weight as the distance temperature is increased. This is to make sure agents prioritize nearby fires over distant fires, resulting in a more efficient use of their time and resources.

We also decreased the temperature for the suppressing power component to decrease its impact on the overall score. This way, even if an agent's fire reduction power isn't very high, it won't be deterred from tackling high intensity fires.

Lastly, we highly increased the fire level temperature to put more importance on lower intensity fires. This way, agents will be more likely to target and put out fires before they become too intensive and harder to put out.

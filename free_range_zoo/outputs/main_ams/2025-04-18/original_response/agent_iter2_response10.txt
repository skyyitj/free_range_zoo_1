Based on the results and feedback, there's room for an improvement in the average suppressant efficiency and average fire intensity change metrics, suggesting that agents are currently not very efficient in extinguishing fires with the available resources. Also, the average steps to complete the task is somewhat high, so we should aim to decrease this. 

Therefore, here's a revised version of the policy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:
    # === Fire Task Selection Scoring ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None
    
    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):
        
        # Change: added a suppressant factor in the calculation of dist
        # This would now consider the amount of suppressant available with the agents while calculating distance
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+0.001)

        # Change: Introduce an intensity factor in the score formula
        # Add a factor of np.exp(-fire_intensity) in the score calculation to efficiently target high intensity fires
        intensity_factor = np.exp(-fire_intensity)
        suppressant_factor = (agent_fire_reduction_power / (fire_intensity+0.001)) * agent_suppressant_num
        score = fire_weight * suppressant_factor * intensity_factor - dist * fire_intensity
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

This version of the function includes an intensity factor in the score calculation, which prioritizes the high intensity fires. Plus, we've added a small constant (0.001) in denominator which prevents undefined behavior for fire_intensity and agent_suppressant_num = 0 and thus, contributes to better estimation of distance and suppressant_factor. This policy should effectively improve the suppressant efficiency, fire intensity change, and possibly decrease the average steps as well.

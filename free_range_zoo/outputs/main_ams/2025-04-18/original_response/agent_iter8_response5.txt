The policy function has been revised to add a new factor - agent_concentration. If there are too many agents in a particular area, the score will be reduced. This allows each agent to distribute more evenly to different fires, rather than concentrating all agents on one or few fires. The temperature coefficients for each factor have also been adjusted to balance their influence on the computed score. Distances and agent's firefighting potency have a smaller temperature coefficient, so they have a smaller impact on the score; while the fire's level has a larger temperature coefficient, so it has a larger impact. This adjustment is made with the intention to prioritize more urgent fires with higher levels.

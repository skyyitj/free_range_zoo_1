In our updated policy, we've adjusted the temperature coefficients and introduced a new factor that considers fire intensity when calculating the score. The new fire intensity score helps the agent to prioritise fires that are currently at high intensity levels. It does so by assigning greater scores to higher intensity fires, resulting in the agent more likely selecting these fires for suppression if all other factors are equal. The adjustments to the temperature coefficients aim to provide a better balance between the importance of distance, suppression power and fire intensity in the agent's decision making.

Based on the evaluation results, the agent's performance regarding fire control efficiency needs some improvement. There are some fires still existing and not being handled towards the end (evidenced by Average Burning Number) and fires seem to burn out without being handled (shown by Average Burnedout Number). The Negative average Fire Intensity Change indicates that the fire is not being controlled effectively. Also, the low value of Average Putout Number suggests that the agent may not act effectively to control or extinguish fires. Moreover, the amount of agent suppressant being used is quite high, which indicates unnecessary resource expenditure. This could be addressed by improving task prioritization, especially towards the fires that are more intense and closer to the agent. 

To improve performance, the agents' policy function has to be modified to improve their ability to evaluate and select optimal tasks.  

The revised policy function is given below:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Calculate the distance between the agent and the fire
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5

        # Score = Weight / Distance² × Suppression Potential - Fire Intensity² 
        # This helps to prioritize fires that are closer and highly intense
        # It also considers agent's fire reduction ability, which can increase agent's effectiveness. 

        score = fire_weight / (dist*dist) * (agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power/fire_intensity) - (fire_intensity*fire_intensity)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

The revised policy function now priorities fires based on their distance, intensity, and the agent's fire reduction capability. A higher intensity fire and those closer to the agent are now prioritized, which will help in controlling or reducing fire more effectively. Furthermore, using the square of the distance and fire intensity in the score calculation will magnify the effect of these factors, leading to better task prioritization.

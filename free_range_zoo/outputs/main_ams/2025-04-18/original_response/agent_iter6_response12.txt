def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    # === Scoring Fire Tasks ===
    max_score = -float('inf')
    best_fire = None
    temperature = 0.05  # Adjust the temperature to balance the decision difference

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor is increasingly important with higher fire levels
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num + 0.9 * fire_level + 1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor is highly focused on intense fires
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + (fire_level / 10.0) + 1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, and distance factor
        # Fire level is added linearly to the score with increased weighting, to avoid the fire burning out from prolongation
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power + 0.1 * fire_level) / (dist * temperature))

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```
Here, the policy is adjusted as follows:
1. Increased the temperature slightly to make the agent's decision-making more variance.
2. The agent's judgment of distance now takes into account the level of the fire.
3. The influence of the fire's intensity on suppressant effectiveness is also impacted by fire level.
4. The fire level is now incorporated into the score calculation with a higher weight, forcing the agent to pay more attention to high-level fires. This encourages an agent to extinguish the most dangerous fires first which maximizes the overall fire control effect.
These modifications aim to improve task handling and suppressant efficiency and reduce the occurrence of burnout.

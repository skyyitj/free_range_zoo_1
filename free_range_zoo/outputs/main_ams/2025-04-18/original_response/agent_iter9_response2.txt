    max_score = -float('inf')
    best_fire = None

    dist_temperature = 0.6  # Increased to address suppressant waste problem and fire severity
    suppress_power_temperature = 0.01  # Maintained as previous value
    fire_level_temperature = 1.2  # Increased to prioritize lower level fires

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor with higher weight
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with lower weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

This new policy further augments the importance of distance, causing agents to favour nearby fires. Moreover, fire intensity is now accounted better in the decision by agents, allowing for more efficient suppressant usage. The suppressant power is considered in score formulation but it doesn't hold as much sway as other factors. Furthermore, the raised fire level temperature prompts agents to eliminate fires before they can escalate into more intense incidences. As a result, fewer fires burn out without being addressed, leading to doube-fold benefits; lesser area is devastated by fire and agent performance improves in terms of gaining more rewards.

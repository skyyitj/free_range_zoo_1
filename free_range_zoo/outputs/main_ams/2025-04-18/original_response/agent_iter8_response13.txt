In this updated policy, we made the following changes:

1. We increased the temperature of the distance factor to-weight the distance. This would encourage agents to select fires that are closer, which should result in less wasted time and resources when moving to the fire.

2. We also increased the temperature of the fire_level factor. This would allow the agent to prioritize fires with higher intensity. The agent won't shy away from big fires due to a higher fire level.

The updated policy should result in a better performance, as it would help the agents to make a better decision when selecting which fire to fight. It balances the need to quickly respond to fires that are close by and those with higher intensity levels. The use of temperature tunable parameters allows us to achieve this balance, and further tuning can be done to optimize performance.

In this improved policy, the temperature coefficient of the distance factor was decreased, making the agents favor closer fires even more. At the same time, the temperature coefficient of the firefighting efficiency factor was increased to decrease its impact on the decision making. The temperature coefficient of the fire level factor was increased, making the agents prioritize the fires with higher intensity more. This should improve the agents' ability to control and suppress the fires, lead to more efficient use of the suppressants and increase the total rewards.

Given the policy evaluation results, it is evident that the agents are having a hard time effectively managing the fires. In particular, we see quite a high average of fires that are still burning (Average Burning Number: 4.3745), fires that have burned out without being managed (Average Burnedout Number: 2.8000), and the average steps taken to complete the task is quite high as well (Average Steps: 6.8667). These all indicate performance issues that we need to address.

We should also aim to improve the Suppressant Efficiency (1.0033 intensity/suppressant) and the Fire Intensity Change (-1.00). 

The following policy function is suggested to improve the firefighting efficiency and resource utilization:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    # === Scoring all the fire tasks for the agents ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor consideration for task selection 
        distance_factor = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Efficiency in firefighting factor in task selection 
        firefighting_efficiency = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1)

        # Score computation considering weight in prioritizing tasks, efficiency in firefighting and distance factor
        score = fire_weight * firefighting_efficiency / (distance_factor + 1)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

The revised policy function consist of modifications to the distance factor and the firefighting efficiency factor, and adjustments to the computation in score to fit the changes. With this revised policy function, it'd more strategically guide the agent to prioritize more crucial fires, utilize fire suppression resources effectively, and optimize movement around the agent.

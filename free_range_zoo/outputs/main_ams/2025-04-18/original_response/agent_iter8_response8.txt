The changes have been made to potentiate the distance and suppression power factors, such that the policy becomes more sensitive to the distance of fires and the remaining amount of available suppressant. The temperature coefficients for distance and suppression power have been incremented for greater influence of these components in task scoring. This modification is expected to improve the efficiency of firefighting tasks, especially when the fires are distant and the suppressant is running low.

        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with lower weight

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + fire_level * fire_level_temperature) / suppress_power_temperature)

In the new policy, we made the following updates:

1. We adjusted the temperature coefficients for the distance and suppression power factors from 0.1 and 0.05 to 0.07 and 0.04 respectively to give less weight to these factors. This change should make the score more balanced, leading to more efficient use of the suppressants.

2. We increased the temperature coefficient for the fire level factor from 0.02 to 0.03. This change should allow the agent to consider the fire intensity level more in its decision, thus forcing the agent to prioritize fires with higher intensity. Such adjustment should decrease the "Average Burning Number" and increase "Average Putout Number" and "Average Fire Intensity Change" metrics.

3. These adjustments were made based on the evaluation metrics. Although the suppressant efficiency seems fairly high, the Average Fire Intensity Change and Average Putout Number are low, indicating that the fires are not being put out efficiently. Therefore, adjusting the weights will help balance these factors and improve the overall performance of the agents. Specifically, the adjustment in weights will influence the "Fire Intensity Change", "Used Suppressant", "Burning Number", "Putout Number", and "Burnedout Number" metrics.

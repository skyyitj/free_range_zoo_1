        # Distance-based factor for task selection
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor in task selection
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1)

        # Socre calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, and distance factor
        # Include the fire level as an additional factor to prioritize fires with higher levels
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist + 1) * (fire_level + 1)) / temperature)

In the modified policy, the temperature parameter has been reduced further to increase the differences in scores between fires, leading to more decisive choice by the agent. The weight of fire level in score calculation has been modified into a multiplicative factor with fire_weight and /suppression_power/dist. The introduction of fire level into these components allows prioritizing fires with higher levels and closer distances, which can help increase the efficiency of fire control and suppressant usage. And the "+1" in fire level will ensure this policy can handle the case when there is a new fire with level 0. The modified policy aims to achieve a balance between efficient fire control and judicious use of resources, reducing burned-out fires and improving overall performance.

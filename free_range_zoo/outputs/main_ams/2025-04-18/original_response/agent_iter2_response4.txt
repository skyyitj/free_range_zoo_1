Based on the results and feedback, it is observed that the "Suppressant Efficiency" is slightly lower than before, indicating that agents still need to be more efficient in using their suppressants to extinguish fires. Also, the "Average Steps" metric is high, suggesting that agents take a relatively large number of steps to complete the task. 

To optimize the policy function further, we can create a grid that represents the spread of fire around each fire's location. This will help agents avoid areas with high fire spread potential and direct agents to act on fires with a higher reward-to-risk ratio. 

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:
    # === Fire Task Selection Scoring ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None
    
    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance between the agent and the fire
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5

        # Fire risk factor considering the spread of the fire around the fire's position
        risk_factor = (1 + fire_intensity) ** 2
        # Suppression factor considering the agent's fire reduction power and available suppressants
        suppressant_factor = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / risk_factor

        # Final score considering the distance, fire risk, fire weight, and suppression factor
        score = fire_weight * suppressant_factor / (dist * risk_factor)
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

The revised score calculation considers the risk factor, which potentially optimizes the agents' action based on the spread of the fire around each fire position. It also includes the suppressant factor to improve the efficiency of the agent's suppressant usage. By optimizing the suppressant allocation and agents' actions based on the fire spread potential, the "Suppressant Efficiency" and "Average Steps" metrics should improve.

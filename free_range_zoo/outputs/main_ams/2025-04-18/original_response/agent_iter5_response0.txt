    temperature_suppression = 0.1  # Increased temperature value to downscale suppression power.

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance-based factor for task selection
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor in task selection, the temperature value is increase for this metric to make it less dominate in the decision.
        suppression_power = np.exp(agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1))/ temperature_suppression

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, and distance factor
        score = fire_weight * suppression_power / (np.exp(dist + 1) / temperature_distance) + 2 * fire_level

In this revised policy, we have adjusted the temperature parameters to better balance the influence of different factors. We increased the temperature value for the suppression power-based factor to make it less dominant in decision making, allowing other factors, notably distance and fire level, to have a more pronounced impact. The aim is to encourage less resource consumption (reducing the "Used Suppressant" metric) while still effectively controlling the fire (increasing the "Fire Intensity Change" metric). The added emphasis on fire level is intended to decrease the "Burnedout Number". The optimizations are expected to improve overall performance, as measured by the "Rewards" metric.

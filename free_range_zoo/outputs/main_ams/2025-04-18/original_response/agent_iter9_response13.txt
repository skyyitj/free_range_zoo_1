    best_fire = None

    dist_temperature = 0.1  # Adjusted to put less weight on distance.
    suppress_power_temperature = 0.8  # Adjusted to increase weight on suppressing power.
    fire_level_temperature = 0.4  # Adjusted to put significant importance on the fire level.

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor with lower weight
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with more weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

In this new policy function, we reduce the weightage on the distance factor to allow the agent be selected for far but intense fires. We have decreased the `dist_temperature` which increases the effect of distance in our score. 

We increase the `suppress_power_temperature` to put more emphasis on the suppression power of the agent. It will allow agents with higher suppression power to be allocated to more intense fires.

Lastly, we decrease the `fire_level_temperature` to give more importance to higher intensity fires as we want the agent to put out the most dangerous fires first.

In this new policy, the score is calculated considering the weightage of the fire (priority), the agent's relative strength to the intensity of fire, and the distance of the agent from the fire. Two temperature parameters for the score components have been considered - one for the fire strength and one for the distance. The distance is given a better weightage considering the quicker the agent reaches the fire, the less likely the fire is to spread. Thus encouraging agents to complete nearer tasks quicker. A lower relative strength score means the fire is too big for the agent to handle, so it should prioritize other tasks. High relative strength scores mean that the agent has enough resources to handle the fire and it should be prioritized. The exponential function is used to normalize these factors and make the score discriminatory. The temperature parameters will determine the importance of each element in the score.

Given the above policy metrics, it seems overall performance of the agent can be improved. Specifically, the Burning Number and Burnedout Number are quite high, indicating a number of fires were not handled efficiently or at all. Also, the Putout Number is rather low, which means that a lower number of fires were extinguished compared to the requirements. Efficiency of the used suppressant (Average Suppressant Efficiency) is also quite low. 

An improved policy function which looks into these factors more deeply and prioritizes fires based on intensity, agent location, suppressant power and availability is required to improve overall efficiency and suppressant use. 

Below is the updated policy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None

    # Individual temperature factors for different score components
    temperature_distance = 0.1
    temperature_intensity = 0.5
    temperature_level = 0.7

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Normalize and compute the score components with respect to their individual temperature factors
        distance_score = np.exp(-np.linalg.norm(np.subtract(agent_pos, fire_position)) / temperature_distance)
        intensity_score = np.exp(fire_intensity / temperature_intensity)
        level_score = np.exp(fire_level / temperature_level)

        # Calculate suppression efficiency score considering agent's fire reduction power and available suppressant resources
        suppression_score = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1)

        # Compute overall score for the fire task considering the task weight, distance, intensity, level scores and suppression score
        task_score = fire_weight * distance_score * intensity_score * level_score * suppression_score

        if task_score > max_score:
            max_score = task_score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

This updated policy function introduces individual temperature factors for different features like distance, intensity and level of the fire. It ensures that the scores for these features are normalized in the range of 0 and 1 which helps in more effective comparative analysis of different fires when assigning tasks to agents. This would result in balanced and an improved selection of fire tasks.

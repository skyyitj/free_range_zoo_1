        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + fire_level * fire_level_temperature) / suppress_power_temperature)

    return best_fire
```

Looking at the feedback we received, the average fire intensity change seems to be quite low, whereas the number of burning and burnedout fires is still quite high. Therefore, we adjusted the policy by reducing the temperature coefficient for the distance factor. This would make agents prioritize fires closer to them and possibly increase their efficiency in controlling fires, leading to lower fire intensity.

We've also increased the temperature coefficient for fire levels, which should make our agents more sensitive to the intensity of fires and therefore prioritize high-intensity fires even more. This change should also help in reducing the number of burning and burnedout fires, and lead to a more efficient fire suppressant usage. 

However, the performance of the policy function depends on the actual scenario, and specific results can be different. You can continue to refine it according to your needs and the actual feedback in the real application.

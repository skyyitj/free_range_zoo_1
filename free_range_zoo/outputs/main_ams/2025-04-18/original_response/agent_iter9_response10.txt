def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int],

) -> int:

    # === Adjusting Scoring Criteria ===
    max_score = -float('inf')
    best_fire = None

    dist_temperature = 0.15  # Lowered to reduce weight on distance.
    suppress_power_temperature = 0.1  # Increased to put more weight on suppressing power.
    fire_level_temperature = 0.9  # Increase fire level temperature to encourage agents to extinguish higher level fire early.

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor with lower weight
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with higher weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp( (fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature )

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

The above revised policy function modified the temperature of the distance factor, reduction power, and fire level. 

The distance temperature was decreased to reduce the overall weight of the distance in the score calculation. This would get the agent to fight further fires if they are of higher level or priority, instead of only focusing on the nearby ones.

The temperature of the agent's firefighting ability was increased, This would get the agents with higher suppression power to focus on fires with higher intensity instead of all agents running after same fire.

Lastly, the temperature for the fire level was increased. This will ensure that agents try to combat fires with higher level first, hence preventing them from reaching critical levels.

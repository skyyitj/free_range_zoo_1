Continuing with steps for raising the results of the policy function, the following updated version of the function tries to address the deficits and improve the efficiency of wildfire control.

The main change regards the way of scoring firefighting tasks. This version calculates the score based on the distance between agent's location and fire's location, fire intensity and fire level, available suppression resources as well as their fire reduction power. It also takes to account the priority the fire according to its associated weight.

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    # weight factors
    weight_dist = 0.2
    weight_intensity = 0.4
    weight_level = 0.2
    weight_resource = 0.2

    best_fire = None
    best_score = -np.inf

    for i, (pos, level, intensity) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities)):

        # position factors
        self_dist = np.sqrt((pos[0] - agent_pos[0])**2 + (pos[1] - agent_pos[1])**2)
        other_dist = [np.sqrt((pos[0] - o_pos[0])**2 + (pos[1] - o_pos[1])**2) for o_pos in other_agents_pos]
        
        min_other_dist = min(other_dist) if other_dist else np.inf
        dist_factor = self_dist / (1 + min_other_dist)

        # fire factors
        level_factor = level
        intensity_factor = intensity

        # agent factors
        resource_factor = agent_suppressant_num / (1 + intensity)

        score = (fire_putout_weight[i] 
                 - weight_dist * dist_factor 
                 - weight_level * level_factor 
                 - weight_intensity * intensity_factor 
                 - weight_resource * resource_factor)

        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

The new policy function is expected to improve fire control performance by evaluating distance to fire, fire level and intensity, and availability of suppression resources in a balancing way. The agent would decide upon the fire with the best evaluated score, thus improving effectiveness and efficiency of fire control.

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor with higher weight
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with lower weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + fire_level * fire_level_temperature) / suppress_power_temperature)

```

In the revised policy, we adjust the temperature coefficients for the distance and suppression power factors, giving lower weight to the distance factor. This should enable the agents to prioritize fires further from them, diversifying the fire fighting efforts. It also increases the weight of the firefighting efficiency factor, which will increase the impact of having high suppressant resources on the agent's decision making. Therefore agents will be more likely to step up their efforts in fighting fires based on having high suppressant resources.

We also adjust the fire_level_temperature to give more consideration to the fire level. This should make the agent prioritize higher level fires more efficiently. This could possibly optimize the usage of the suppressant by the agents and lead to a reduction in fire intensity at a higher rate, leading to a higher average of extinguished fires and a lower average of the burning number.

Let's try to revise the policy function to improve upon the metrics, particularly focusing on lowering the "Average Burning Number", increasing the "Average Putout Number", lowering the "Average Burnedout Number", reducing the "Average Used Suppressant", and increasing the "Suppressant Efficiency".

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 
    
    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)

    # Temperature parameters for intensity and distance
    temperature_intensity = 0.5
    temperature_distance = 0.5

    # Initialize a placeholder for the maximum score and the associated task.
    max_score = -np.inf
    best_fire = None

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        fire_intensity = fire_intensities[i]
        fire_level = fire_levels[i]
        fire_weight = fire_putout_weight[i]

        # Calculate the Euclidean distance to the fire.
        dist_to_fire = np.sqrt((fire_pos[i][0] - agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_pos[i][1] - agent_pos[1])**2)

        f_power = agent_fire_reduction_power

        # Define scoring function considering intensity, distance to fire, suppressant efficiency and fire weight
        score = fire_weight / (np.exp(fire_intensity/temperature_intensity) + np.exp(dist_to_fire/temperature_distance)) 

        # Prefer fires where the agent has a higher power to suppress and where agent's suppressant is enough
        if fire_intensity <= f_power and agent_suppressant_num >= fire_level:
            score *= 2

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```
This version of the policy function changes the score calculation from a subtraction to a division operation between weighted task priority and the exponential transformation of intensity and distance. This scoring schema encourages tasks that are closer and have reduced intensity, given the temperature adjustments for distance and intensity.

We've also added a term to prefer fires where the agent's reduction power is higher than the fireâ€™s intensity and where agent's suppressant is enough to put out the fire, and we calculate it because the agent appears to be more capable of successfully extinguishing the fire in such circumstances. The result of this is that agents can select tasks that can be completed in fewer steps, resulting in a lower "Average Steps" value. By this method, it would also decrease the 'Average Burning Number' and increase the 'Average Putout Number' which was our primary focus.

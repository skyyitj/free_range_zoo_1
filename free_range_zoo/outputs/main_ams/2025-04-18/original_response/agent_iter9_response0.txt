Here, we introduced a new scoring component for fire intensity (fire_intensity_factor). This factor is included to encourage agents to prioritize fires with higher intensities, which may pose a larger threat if left uncontrolled. The temperature for this component (intensity_temperature) is kept low to balance its impact on the overall score.

We also adjusted the other parameters to achieve a better balance between immediate fire control and resource conservation. We increased the distance temperature (dist_temperature) to make agents prioritize nearby fires over distant ones. The suppressing power temperature (suppress_power_temperature) was also adjusted for a balanced effect on the final score. Lastly, we maintained the fire level temperature (fire_level_temperature) at a high value to keep the importance of fire level in the scoring. This helps agents to respond quickly to fires at early stages, preventing large scale fires.

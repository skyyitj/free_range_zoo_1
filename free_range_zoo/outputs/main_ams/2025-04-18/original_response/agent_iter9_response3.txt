        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-9)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with higher weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-9) / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

Based on the performance metrics from earlier, we noticed that the original policy does not make efficient use of the suppressant resource, which leads to subpar fire control. This was indicated by the high average fire intensity change and the high average burning number.

Therefore, in the revised policy, one of the key changes we implemented is to increase the weight for suppressing power in the score calculation. This change enables us to better utilize the agent's fire reduction power and thus potentially improve the average fire intensity change.

Another important revision is the increase in the fire level temperature. This change aims to prioritize the fire tasks based on their intensity levels and thus could potentially lower the average burning number. 

Lastly, we also decreased the weightage that the distance plays in task selection. This way, when selecting the most important fire task, the impact of distance is lowered, which helps the agent to avoid focusing only on closer fires, but on the most intense ones. 

The revised policy essentially attempts to balance the efficiency of firefighting, taking into consideration the distance, the agents' suppressing power, and the level of the fire. Hence, this should lead to better fire control and optimal use of resources.

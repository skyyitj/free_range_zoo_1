    for agent in other_agents_pos:
        dist_to_fire = [((fpos[0]-agent[0])**2 + (fpos[1]-agent[1])**2)**0.5 for fpos in fire_pos]
        other_agents_target[np.argmin(dist_to_fire)] += 1  # Assume other agents will head to the nearest fire

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        #distance factor
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1e-7)

        #firefighting efficiency factor
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        #Consider the fire putout weight as well as other parameters
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * (fire_level+1e-7) / ((dist_temperature * dist + 1) * (other_agents_target[i]+1)) + suppression_power * suppress_power_temperature) / fire_level_temperature)

            max_score = score

    return best_fire
```
In this revised policy, in addition to adjusting the weights for distance, fire reduction power and fire level, an additional change was made to consider other agents' likely targets. By assuming that each other agent will target the fire nearest to it, the policy can increase the score for fires not being targeted by any other agent and decrease the score for fires being targeted by multiple agents, helping to avoid all agents clustering around a single fire while others are left unattended.

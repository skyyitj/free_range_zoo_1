    weight_temp = 0.03

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance factor (incorporating suppressant into the distance factor to encourage the agent to move closer to the fire)
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor (using np.exp to amplify the differentiation)
        suppressant_needed = fire_intensity / agent_fire_reduction_power
        suppression_power = np.exp(agent_suppressant_num / suppressant_needed) if agent_suppressant_num < suppressant_needed else np.exp(suppressant_needed / agent_suppressant_num)
        suppression_power /= suppression_temp

        # Score calculation
        # Balance the weight and the firefighting efficiency (both using np.exp to amplify the differentiation)
        score = (np.exp(fire_weight) / weight_temp) * suppression_power - dist

            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

```

In this updated policy, we made the following changes:
1. Lowered the temperature parameters of both weight and efficiency. The lower temperatures will amplify the score differences, making the agent to more aggressively differentiate between the fires.
2. Enhance the suppression power calculation by factoring in the needed suppressant and the available suppressant.
3. The efficient usage of suppressants by ensuring agents control the fires that they can handle within their capabilities, this will help in maximizing the suppressant efficiency metric.
4. Incorporated the suppressant into the distance factor, encouraging the agent to move closer to the fire when it has more suppressants. Therefore, creating a balance between moving and reducing the fire intensities.
5. Reweighted the components in the final score calculation. By this change we are ensuring the agents are giving higher importance to firefighting efficiency while also considering the weighted importance of the fire. This may contribute to lower fire intensities and better utilization of the suppressants.

Given the policy evaluation results, it is clear that the agents are struggling to handle the fires efficiently. In particular, the results show a relatively high average number of fires that are unhandled (Burning Number: 4.3745) and fires that have burned out without being managed (Burnedout Number: 2.8000). Moreover, the suppressant efficiency is not very high (Average Suppressant Efficiency: 1.0033 intensity/suppressant), indicating rooms for improvement in the current policy.

To achieve better performance and efficiency, the policy should also consider other factors such as the distance to the fire and the intensity of fire. Here, I propose an updated version of the policy function:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    # Initialize the best score and index
    best_score = -1
    best_index = -1

    for i in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance between the agent and the fire
        distance = ((agent_pos[0]-fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1]-fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5

        # Calculate the potential impact of putting out the fire, considering the agent's power, the fire's intensity and the agent's remaining suppressants
        impact = (agent_fire_reduction_power * min(agent_suppressant_num, fire_levels[i])) / (fire_intensities[i] + 1)
       
        # Calculate the score for this fire, taking into account the fire's weight, the potential impact and the distance 
        score = fire_putout_weight[i] * impact / (distance + 1)

        # Update the best score and index if the current score is higher
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            best_index = i

    return best_index
```

In this revised policy function, we included a distance factor to the scoring system. The newly added distance factor incentivizes agents to take actions where they can make the most impact, while considering the travel cost. The policy should perform better in terms of resource utilization and task completion time.

The policy function can be optimized by incorporating an additional strategy related to agent collaboration.  Particularly, if an agent finds that another agent is also targeting the same fire, it might be more effective to choose a different fire to suppress. Here's a proposed version of the policy function that includes this adjustment:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    num_fires = len(fire_pos)
    num_agents = 1 + len(other_agents_pos)
    
    # Calculate distances from each agent to each fire
    dist = [[((y-x[0])**2 + (z-x[1])**2)**0.5 for y, z in fire_pos] for x in [agent_pos, *other_agents_pos]]
    
    # Calculate the minimum distance to each fire for all agents
    min_dist = [min(x) for x in zip(*dist)]
    
    # Calculate fire priorities as the weighted average of fire level and fire intensity, adjusted by the fire weight
    fire_priority = [a*b*c/(d**2+1) for a, b, c, d in zip(fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight, min_dist)]
    
    # If another agent is closer to a fire, decrease its priority
    for i in range(num_fires):
        if min_dist[i] < dist[0][i]:
            fire_priority[i] *= 0.5
    
    # Return the fire with the highest priority
    return fire_priority.index(max(fire_priority))
```

By using this function, each agent will prioritize fires based not only on their distance, level, and intensity, but also on whether there's a closer agent that can handle the fire. The updated policy function also has slight changes in the fire priority computation formula to account for the changes. This strategic revision of the policy function should minimize agent overuse on a single fire and increase the overall efficiency of fire suppression, controlling fire levels more effectively.

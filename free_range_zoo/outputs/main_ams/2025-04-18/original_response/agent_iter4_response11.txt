def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 
    fire_levels: List[int], 
    fire_intensities: List[float], 

    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    # === Scoring Fire Tasks ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None
    temperature1 = 0.2  # Adjust temperature parameter to control differentiation in scoring
    temperature2 = 0.5  # Introduce a second temperature for distance-based factor

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Adjusted distance-based factor for task selection
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+0.5)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor in task selection
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 0.5)

        # Adjusted score calculation
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power ** temperature1 / (dist + 0.5) ** temperature2 + fire_level) / temperature1)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

In the revised policy, I have added a second temperature parameter, which specifically controls the factor for distance-based considerations. This will provide greater flexibility in balancing the trade-offs among different factors in scoring fire suppression tasks.

Additionally, I have adjusted the original temperature and added a small value (0.5) to the denominators in the distance and suppression power computations. This is to prevent potential issues with division by zero or very small numbers, which could lead to overly large scores and poor differentiation among different tasks.

Finally, note that the modulations of suppression power and distance are now raised to the power of respective temperature parameters. This is to control and adjust the impact of these factors on the overall task score. This raises the differentiation among tasks to a higher degree, especially those with different suppression power and distance factors.

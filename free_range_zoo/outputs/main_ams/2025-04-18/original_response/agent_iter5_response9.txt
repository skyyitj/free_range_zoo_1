    # === Scoring Fire Tasks ===
    max_score = float('-inf')
    best_fire = None
    temperature = 0.01  # Lower the temperature parameter to further amplify the score differences

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        # Distance-based factor for task selection
        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num + 1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor in task selection
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, and distance factor
        # Include the fire level as an additional factor to prioritize fires with higher levels
        # Increasing the weight of fire level in evaluation to handle high intensity fires
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist + 1) + 5 * fire_level) / temperature)

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```
In revised policy function, we decrease the temperature parameter to amplify the score differences more. Also, we increase the weight of the fire level in the score calculation by changing it from 2 to 5. This is because the evaluation results show a relatively high number of burned-out fires and high intensity change, which indicates that the agent may not adequately handle the fires with higher intensity. The revised policy emphasizes more on the fire level which can help the agent to reduce the number of burned-out fires and improve the control on fire intensity.

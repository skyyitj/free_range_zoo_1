        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5 / (agent_suppressant_num+1)

        # Firefighting efficiency factor with lower weight
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity+1)

        # Score calculation considering prioritization weight, firefighting efficiency, distance factor, and fire level.
        score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power / (dist_temperature * dist + 1) + fire_level * fire_level_temperature) / suppress_power_temperature)

In the revised policy, we increase the temperature coefficients for the distance and fire level factors. This assigns higher importance to the proximity and intensity of fires, further incentivising the agents to target closer and more intense fires. We also reduce the temperature coefficient for the suppression power factor. This reduces the impact of the agents' fire reduction capability on their decision-making, lessening the deterrent effect of possessing low suppressant resources. This should improve the overall task completion time and suppressant efficiency and, as a consequence, improve the accumulated rewards and the average number of fires put out.

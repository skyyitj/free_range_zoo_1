    best_fire = -1
    
    temperature_fire = 0.05 
    temperature_agent = 0.0005 
    temperature_dist = 0.3 

    for i, (fire_position, fire_level, fire_intensity, fire_weight) in enumerate(zip(fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities, fire_putout_weight)):

        dist = ((fire_position[0]-agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_position[1]-agent_pos[1])**2)**0.5
        suppression_power = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num / (fire_intensity + 1)

        distance_score = np.exp(-dist / temperature_dist) 

        fire_score = np.exp((fire_weight * suppression_power) / (temperature_agent+1))
        
        intensity_score = np.exp(fire_level / (temperature_fire + 1)) 
        
        score = distance_score + fire_score + intensity_score

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_fire = i

    return best_fire
```

In this revised policy, we combine three scores together to decide which fire to extinguish: the distance score, the fire score, and the intensity score. 

The distance score is based on the distance between the agent and the fire, where the close fire has a higher score. 

The fire score is calculated from the suppression power of the agent and the weight of the fire. The high suppression power and high weight fire will get a higher score. 

The intensity score directly comes from the fire level, and the higher fire level gets a higher score. We use this score to prevent the fire from burning out. 

We combine these scores together to make a final decision. 

The temperature of each score could be used to balance the influence of each factor. The lower temperature will emphasize the importance of this factor. 

With these three factors considered together, the agent will balance between cleaning up the nearby lighter fire and long-distance high-result fire, and also prevent the fire from burning out.

Here is a policy function designed to optimally assign firefighting tasks to agents based on the provided rules and objectives:

```python

    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity levels of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity values of each fire task

### Explanation:
1. **Distance Consideration**: Tasks closer to the agent are given a higher score using an exponential decay function. This ensures agents prioritize nearby fires for faster response times.
   
2. **Fire Intensity**: Fires with higher intensity levels are weighted more heavily to prevent spread and control major fires.

3. **Priority Weight**: The reward weights are integrated into the score to align agent decisions with strategic priorities.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: The suppressing effectiveness is calculated based on the agent's fire reduction power and available suppressant. Tasks are prioritized where resource usage is optimal.

5. **Self-Extinguish Avoidance**: Fires nearing self-extinguishing thresholds are penalized to prevent unnecessary suppressant consumption or penalties.

6. **Score Normalization**: All scoring components are transformed using exponential functions with adjustable temperatures. This allows fine-tuning the sensitivity of the scoring system.

By combining these factors, the policy ensures intelligent and adaptive task assignments for wildfire suppression.

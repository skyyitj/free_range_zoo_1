Below is the implementation of the `single_agent_policy` function, which balances the considerations of fire suppression, resource conservation, and reward prioritization:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    import numpy as np

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []

    # Temperature parameters for control over scoring components
    distance_temp = 10.0  # Affects distance-based scoring
    intensity_temp = 1.0  # Affects fire intensity-based scoring
    reward_temp = 1.0     # Affects reward-based scoring

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Distance from agent to fire task
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[i]
        agent_y, agent_x = agent_pos
        distance = np.sqrt((fire_y - agent_y) ** 2 + (fire_x - agent_x) ** 2)
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance / distance_temp)

        # Fire intensity and remaining difficulty after suppression
        fire_intensity = fire_intensities[i]
        predicted_remaining_fire = max(
            fire_intensity - (agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power), 0
        )
        intensity_score = np.exp(-predicted_remaining_fire / intensity_temp)

        # Reward prioritization
        reward_score = np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / reward_temp)

        # Aggregate score based on components
        total_score = distance_score * intensity_score * reward_score
        scores.append(total_score)

    # Choose the fire task with the highest score
    best_task_index = int(np.argmax(scores))
    return best_task_index
``` 

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Distance Score:**  
   Fires closer to the agent are prioritized to reduce travel time. A temperature parameter (`distance_temp`) controls the sensitivity of score decrement based on distance.
   
2. **Intensity Score:**  
   Tasks where the agent can substantially reduce fire intensity are prioritized. The predicted remaining fire intensity after suppression is considered using the agent's power and resources. A temperature parameter (`intensity_temp`) controls how much this score contributes to prioritization.

3. **Reward Score:**  
   Prioritizes tasks with higher reward weights, guiding agents toward critical fire locations. A temperature parameter (`reward_temp`) adjusts sensitivity to reward weights.

4. **Score Aggregation:**  
   The final score for each fire task is computed by multiplying the normalized sub-scores. This ensures tasks with optimal balance of proximity, resource efficiency, and high reward are chosen.

5. **Task Selection:**  
   The task with the highest aggregated score is selected using `np.argmax`.

### Design Benefits:
- **Multi-Factor Optimization:** Uses distance, predicted suppression difficulty, and reward weight to make informed decisions.
- **Resource Conservation:** Agents avoid assigning themselves to tasks that overconsume resources unnecessarily.
- **Reward-Based Guidance:** Directs agents toward tasks with higher strategic value.
- **Distance Awareness:** Incorporates travel distance to improve efficiency.

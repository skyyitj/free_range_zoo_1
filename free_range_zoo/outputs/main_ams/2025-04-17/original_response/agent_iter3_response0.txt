Analyzing the metrics, the average burning number and the average burned out number are quite high which indicates that many fires are not being handled effectively. The putout number is low, indicating that the number of fires put out by agents is not great. The suppressant efficiency is also relatively low, indicating that the overall use of fire suppressant by agents is not very efficient. The average rewards are also not very high, suggesting the agent's task selection process is sub-optimal.

To improve performance, the agent's policy can be updated to incorporate consideration of both the fire intensity and the suppressant availability. Here is a revised policy that assigns tasks to agents:

```python
from typing import Tuple, List
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # Agent Properties
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # Team Information
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # Fire Task Information
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],              

    # Task Prioritization
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """

    best_score = -np.inf  
    best_task = -1 

    # Parameters for the exponential scoring approach
    distance_temp = 0.5  
    intensity_temp = 1.0  
    suppressant_temp = 0.3 

    for task_index in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Compute the Euclidean distance to the fire
        distance = np.linalg.norm(np.subtract(agent_pos, fire_pos[task_index]))

        # Compute the potential extinguishing power of the agent for this fire
        potential_extinguishing_power = min(agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power,
                                            fire_intensities[task_index])

        # Compute task scores
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance_temp * distance)
        intensity_score = np.exp(intensity_temp * potential_extinguishing_power)
        suppressant_score = np.exp(-suppressant_temp * agent_suppressant_num)

        # Compute total score for the task
        total_score = fire_putout_weight[task_index] * (distance_score + intensity_score + suppressant_score)

        # Update best task if total score is higher
        if total_score > best_score:
            best_score = total_score
            best_task = task_index

    return best_task
```

This updated policy function now favorably ranks tasks where the agent can potentially extinguish the fire or at least significantly reduce the fire intensity given their available resources. The tasks are scored based on the distance from the agent, the potential impact of the agent's fire suppressant, and the amount of available suppressant. The policy also takes into account the prioritization weight of each task. This could improve the management of tasks by the agents, enhance suppressant usage efficiency, and hopefully increase the rewards.

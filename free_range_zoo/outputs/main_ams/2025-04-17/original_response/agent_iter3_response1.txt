Analyzing the metrics, the "Average Burning Number", "Average Burnedout Number" and "Average Steps" are quite high, while the "Average Putout Number", "Average Rewards" and "Average Suppressant Efficiency" are relatively low. This suggests that the agents are not effectively prioritizing fires, fires are not being efficiently extinguished or controlled, and the use of suppressants is not very effective.


The policy would be improved by taking into account the intensity of the fire and the amount of suppressant agent has to ensure the agent to work on the fires that it can effectively suppress.The updated policy function would be:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # Agent Properties
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # Team Information
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],

    # Fire Task Information
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],              

    # Task Prioritization
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    This function selects the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """

    # Set an initial minimum distance to inf
    min_distance = np.inf
    # Placeholder for the optimal task
    optimal_task = -1 

    for task_idx in range(len(fire_pos)):
        
        # Calculate Euclidean distance from agent to each fire
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[task_idx][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[task_idx][1])**2)
        
        # Check if the agent has enough suppressant to put out the fire completely or reduce its intensity significantly
        enough_suppressants = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power >= fire_intensities[task_idx]

        # Prioritize tasks with higher weights and which the agent has enough suppressants to handle.
        if fire_putout_weight[task_idx] > min_distance and enough_suppressants:
            min_distance = fire_putout_weight[task_idx]
            optimal_task = task_idx

    return optimal_task
```

This revised policy function prioritizes the fires with higher weights and ensures that the agent has enough resources to handle the fire. This modification will likely help increase the "Average Putout Number", "Average Rewards" and suppressant efficiency, while lowering the "Average Burning Number", "Average Burnedout Number" and "Average Steps".

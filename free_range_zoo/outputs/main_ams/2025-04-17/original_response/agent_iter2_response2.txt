Analyzing the metrics, I see the Average Putout Number and Average Rewards needs to be improved and Average Burning Number, Average Burnedout Number needs to be reduced. This indicates that the agent is not effectively prioritizing the tasks that would yield the highest rewards and not effectively reducing the number of fires. To improve the current situation, a revision of the policy function to include the fire intensity, fire level and distance in the task selection process might help. Here is a revised version of the policy that assigns tasks to agents:

```python
from typing import Tuple, List
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """

    # Adjusted parameters for scoring transformations based on analysis
    distance_temp = 0.05  
    intensity_temp = 0.1  
    level_temp = 0.1  

    highest_score = -np.inf  
    optimal_task = -1   

    for task_index in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Calculate distance from agent to the fire task
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[task_index][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[task_index][1])**2)

        # Calculate scores for each aspect
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance_temp * distance)
        intensity_score = np.exp(-intensity_temp * fire_intensities[task_index])
        level_score = np.exp(-level_temp * fire_levels[task_index])

        # Combine scores with task priority weights
        total_score = (distance_score + intensity_score + level_score) * fire_putout_weight[task_index]

        # Select the task with the highest total score
        if total_score > highest_score:
            highest_score = total_score
            optimal_task = task_index

    return optimal_task
```

The updated policy function now takes into account the distance between agent and fire, fire intensities, and fire level. We are hoping this revised policy might yield better performance by balancing distance, fire intensities and fire level during task assignment which is likely to improve the Average Putout Number and Average Reward and decrease Average Burning Number, Average Burnedout Number and Average Steps.

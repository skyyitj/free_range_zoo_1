From the given results, it appears that the worst policy tends to take more steps, use more suppressant, and yet not able to control the burning fires effectively which results in a larger number of burned-out fires and a lower average reward. This suggests that the policy is not efficient in both controlling the fires and resource utilization. In other words, the agent seems to waste resources on tasks that are not high priority or don't yield high rewards.

To improve this situation, we will redesign the policy function to prioritize fires based on both their intensity and location (distance from the agent). We would also factor in the amount of suppressant needed to control the fire in order to improve the suppressant efficiency and rewards.

```python
from typing import Tuple, List
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    # Define temperature parameters for distance, intensity and suppressant cost transformations
    distance_temp = 5 
    intensity_temp = 2 
    cost_temp = 2
    
    # Placeholder values
    optimal_task = None
    highest_score = -np.inf

    suppressant_cost = agent_suppressant_num / agent_fire_reduction_power

    for i, fire_position in enumerate(fire_pos):
        # Calculate distance, intensity and suppressant cost score
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance_temp * np.linalg.norm(np.array(agent_pos) - np.array(fire_position)))
        intensity_score = np.exp(intensity_temp * fire_intensities[i])
        suppressant_cost_score = np.exp(-cost_temp * suppressant_cost)
        
        # Combine scores according to weights
        total_score = fire_putout_weight[i] * (distance_score + intensity_score + suppressant_cost_score)

        if total_score > highest_score:
            highest_score = total_score
            optimal_task = i

    return optimal_task
``` 

This updated policy function prioritizes fires that are closer in proximity, have higher intensities and requires less suppressant to control. This strategy is anticipated to yield higher rewards and be more resource-efficient.

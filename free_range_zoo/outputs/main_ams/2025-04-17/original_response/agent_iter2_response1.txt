Analyzing the evaluation metrics, we can notice that the average burning number and the average burned out number are quiet high and average putout number is significantly low. These indicate that a considerable number of fires are not being addressed effectively. This finding, in together with the low suppressant efficiency and low rewards, suggest that the agent's task selection is sub-optimal.

One thing that the current policy is not considering is the amount of appropriate resources the agent needs to handle the fire effectively considering the fire intensity and the agent's fire reduction power. The policy should favor the tasks where the agent can extinguish the fire completely or at least reduce the fire intensity significantly within its resource limits.

from typing import List, Tuple

    # Agent Properties
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],

) -> int:

    # Define a placeholder for the objective value of the best task found
    best_task_value = -np.inf  
    # Define a placeholder for the index of the best task found
    best_task_idx = -1  

    # Iterate over all the tasks
    for task_idx in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Calculate the distance to the fire
        distance_to_fire = np.linalg.norm(np.array(agent_pos) - np.array(fire_pos[task_idx]))
        
        # Calculate potential impact of agent on the fire
        potential_impact = min(agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num, fire_intensities[task_idx])

        # Define the importance of a task based on its weight and current fire intensity
        task_importance = fire_putout_weight[task_idx] * fire_intensities[task_idx]

        # Calculate the value of the current task for the agent
        task_value = (potential_impact + task_importance) / (distance_to_fire + 1)  
        
        # If the current task value is greater than the best found so far
        if task_value > best_task_value:
            # Update the best task value and index
            best_task_value = task_value
            best_task_idx = task_idx

    # Return the index of the best task
    return best_task_idx
```

This updated policy function takes into account the distance to the fire, the potential impact of the agent's work on the fire given the agent's available resources, and the importance of the fire based on its relative weight and current intensity. Agents will favor fires that are close, that they can potentially extinguish or significantly reduce, and that have high weights and intensities. This approach aims at improving the agent's resource use efficiency, increasing the number of fires it can extinguish, and in turn, the overall obtained rewards.

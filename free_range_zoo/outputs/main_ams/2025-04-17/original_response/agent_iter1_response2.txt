Given the results from the worst policy, it appears that even though the Average Suppressant Efficiency is relatively high indicating the agents are using their resources efficiently, the Average Rewards and Average Putout Number are low. This suggests the agents are not effectively prioritizing the tasks that would yield the highest rewards. To improve the current situation, a revision of the policy function to better balance the task prioritization by adjusting the scoring system could enhance performance. This includes revising the weights for distance, fire intensity, and fire level in the task selection process. Let's also add an additional factor related to the agent's current resources, to ensure that agents with more resources can take on more challenging tasks:

```python
from typing import Tuple, List
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """

    # Adjusted parameters for scoring transformations based on analysis
    distance_temp = 0.05  # Reduced emphasis on distance to allow broader task selection
    intensity_temp = 0.03  # Increased emphasis on fire intensity
    level_temp = 0.07  # Slightly increased emphasis on fire level
    resource_temp = 0.5  # New parameter for emphasizing the agent's remaining resources

    optimal_task = -1   
    highest_score = -np.inf  

    for task_index in range(len(fire_pos)):
        # Calculate distance from agent to fire task
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[task_index][0]) ** 2 +
                           (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[task_index][1]) ** 2)

        # Calculate normalized (0-1) scores for each aspect
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance_temp * distance)
        intensity_score = np.exp(-intensity_temp * fire_intensities[task_index])
        level_score = np.exp(-level_temp * fire_levels[task_index])
        resource_score = np.exp(resource_temp * (agent_suppressant_num / 10))  # Encourage agents with more resources to take on tougher fires

        # Combine scores with task priority weights
        total_score = (distance_score + intensity_score + level_score + resource_score) * fire_putout_weight[task_index]

        # Select the task with the highest total score
        if total_score > highest_score:
            highest_score = total_score
            optimal_task = task_index

    return optimal_task
```

The revised policy function includes adjustments in the parameters used to transform the distance, intensity, and level scores, alongside a new component accounting for the agent's available resources. By weighting tasks higher for agents with more resources, the policy aims to better match task challenges with agent capabilities, potentially increasing the average put-out number and overall rewards.

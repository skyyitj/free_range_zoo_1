Based on the policy evaluation results, the agent is doing a decent job at reducing fire intensity and extinguishing fires. However, the suppressant efficiency is relatively low, indicating that the agent could use its resources more efficiently. Also, the average number of burning fires is a bit high, suggesting the agent could be more effective at controlling the fire. 

To improve the policy, I am going to increase the agent's sensitivity to the existing fire conditions and give a higher priority to fires that are more intense and closer to the agent. We'll decrease the values of level_temperature and distance_temperature to make them more impactful in our calculations. I would also add an additional factor to consider the existing resources where the agent should be motivated to extinguish the fires that can be done using the existing resources. 

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple
from scipy.spatial import distance

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,               

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                    
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Decrease the temperatures
    level_temperature = 0.10
    intensity_temperature = 0.05
    distance_temperature = 0.05

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])
        resource_efficiency = agent_suppressant_num/fire_intensities[task] if fire_intensities[task] != 0 else 1

        scores[task] = (
            agent_fire_reduction_power * np.exp(-fire_levels[task] * level_temperature) +
            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        ) * fire_putout_weight[task] * resource_efficiency 

    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```

In this version, we decrease temperature values to make the agent more sensitive to fire levels and our distance calculations. We also introduce `resource_efficiency` to incentivize extinguishing fires within the capability of agent resources. This should improve the overall suppressant efficiency and also handle more burning tasks by choosing the optimal task that can be performed using the available resources.

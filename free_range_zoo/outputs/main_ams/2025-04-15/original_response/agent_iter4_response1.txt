Looking at the policy evaluation results, the utiliztion of the suppressant seems to be somewhat inefficient, reflected by the Suppressant Efficiency value. We have a fairly high amount of suppressant used, but the reduction in fire intensity is lower than we'd ideally want, suggesting that the suppressant might be used on difficult to control fires. Considering this logic, we should adjust our policy to consider not only the fire intensity and distance but also the likelihood of the successful control, in particular, accounting for how much the agent can contribute with the available amount of suppresant.

Also, the average number of fires that remain burning by the end ("Burning Number") is still relatively high, so we might be better off focusing our fire control efforts rather than trying to eliminate the fire completely. The fire level and suppressant availability seem to be key factors influencing this outcome.

Following these considerations, let's adjust the policy function:

```python
from scipy.spatial import distance
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    
    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    
    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:

    agent_suppressant_capacity = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power
    
    scores = []
    for i, fp in enumerate(fire_pos):
        # calculate the distance to each fire
        dist = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fp)
        # calculate potential impact, i.e. compare agent's suppressant capacity vs. fire intensity
        impact = min(agent_suppressant_capacity, fire_intensities[i])
        
        # define weights for different factors in the decision. 
        # Here we emphasize the ability of the agent to control the fire and the distance to the fire.
        dist_weight = 1.0
        impact_weight = 1.5
        level_weight = 0.8
        intensity_weight = 0.8
        weight_weight = 1.0

        # normalized score for each fire task
        score = - dist_weight*np.log(dist+1) \
                - level_weight*np.log(fire_levels[i]+1) \
                - intensity_weight*np.log(fire_intensities[i]+1) \
                + weight_weight*fire_putout_weight[i] \
                + impact_weight*np.log(impact+1)
        scores.append(score)
        
    # choose the fire with the highest score
    return np.argmax(scores)
```
I hope that these adjustments can lead to improvements in fire extinguishing, resource usage, and overall task rewards.

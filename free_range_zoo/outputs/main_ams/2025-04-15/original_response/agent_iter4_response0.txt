Looking at the policy feedback and results, there are opportunities for improvement. The Putout Number could be increased and the Fire Intensity Change could be made more negative. 

From the policy function, we see that we're giving importance to the agent's ability to suppress the fire (effect), the current fire level and intensity, and also, the distance from the agent to the fire using the exponential of these values.

There is one more metric that we could add to the score that might increase the Putout Number and lead to a more negative Fire Intensity Change: the number of other agents already going to that fire. We could handle the fires more effectively if we distribute the agents diversely among the fires instead of all going to the same one.

Letâ€™s implement this new consideration and also adjust the temperature values slightly. I'm going to decrease weight_temperature and effect_temperature to 0.4 and add agent_distribution_temperature to be 0.3. Here's the updated function:

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,  

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                     
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.3
    level_temperature = 4.0
    intensity_temperature = 1.5
    weight_temperature = 0.4
    effect_temperature = 0.4
    agent_distribution_temperature = 0.3
    
    # Calculate number of agents going to each fire
    agent_distribution = [(cdist([agent_pos], fire_pos).argmin()) for agent_pos in other_agents_pos]

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect/effect_temperature) \
                -np.exp(agent_distribution.count(i)/agent_distribution_temperature)

        scores.append(score)

    return np.argmax(scores)
```
This should ensure better distribution of agents among the fires, which could improve the overall performance.

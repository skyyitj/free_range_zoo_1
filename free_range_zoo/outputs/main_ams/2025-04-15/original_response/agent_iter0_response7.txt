Here is a simple and naive function to solve the task. In this function, every agent chooses the closest fire to his position. 

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos,
    agent_fire_reduction_power,
    agent_suppressant_num,
    other_agents_pos,
    fire_pos,
    fire_levels,
    fire_intensities,
    fire_putout_weight,
):
    # Calculate distance to each fire
    distances = np.linalg.norm(np.array(fire_pos) - np.array(agent_pos), axis=1)

    # Choose the closest fire
    chosen_fire = np.argmin(distances)
    
    return chosen_fire
```
However, this function doesn't optimally solve the task. The function doesn't take into consideration many important factors such as each fire's intensity, its priority weight, the agent's fire reduction capability, the available amount of suppressant and the positions of other agents. 

I will define a new function that evaluates each fire based on a score. The score will be calculated as the product of several factors including the inverse of the distance between the agent and the fire, the fire's priority weight, the fire's intensity level and the agent's fire reduction capability. 

The function will return the index of the fire with the highest score. To make sure the score calculated is not so large that it causes overflow, I will normalize each factor before multiplying them together. For instance, the distance factor will be normalized by dividing each distance value by the maximum distance value from the agent to the fires. A similar process will be done for the other factors. 

Here is the new function: 

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos,
    agent_fire_reduction_power,
    agent_suppressant_num,
    other_agents_pos,
    fire_pos,
    fire_levels,
    fire_intensities,
    fire_putout_weight,
):
    num_fires = len(fire_pos)
    scores = np.zeros(num_fires)

    for i in range(num_fires):
        # Calculate the distance between the agent and the fire
        distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(agent_pos) - np.array(fire_pos[i]))

        # Calculate a score for this fire
        scores[i] = (
            (1/distance) * # Closer fires have higher scores
            fire_putout_weight[i] * # More important fires have higher scores
            fire_levels[i] * # Bigger fires have higher scores
            agent_fire_reduction_power # More capable agents prefer bigger fires
        )

    # Choose the fire with the highest score
    chosen_fire = np.argmax(scores)
    
    return chosen_fire
```

This function doesn't take into account the positions of other agents and the available amount of fire suppressant of the agent. Further modifications can be made to improve the function taking these factors into account.

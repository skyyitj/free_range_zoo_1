The agents' objective is to suppress fires while minimizing the usage of fire suppressants and the distance traveled. However, the initial policy doesn't balance the use of suppressants well. It heavily depends on the agents' potential to put out fire when choosing a task, without considering the fire intensity sufficiently. 

To solve these problems, the key change in this revised policy is to make the policy more sensitive to fire intensities and fire distances. Theoretically, near and intense fires should be treated with high priority. Thus, temperature for fire intensity is increased and the temperature for fire distance is also significantly increased to make the policy more sensitive to the fire distance, so that we consider the closest fires first. The weight for the expenditure of suppressant has been reduced to balance the usage of suppressants. This is expected to increase the efficiency of suppressant usage.

```

The policy function now considers the minimum distance to the fire among all agents for each fire. 
This way, if a fire is already close to another agent, even if it is closer to the current agent, 
the current agent might choose to go for a fire farther away because it is not that accessible to other agents. 
This leads to a better distribution of agents on the task of fighting each sensitive fire and reduces the burnt out fire number.

Also, I raised the temperature parameter for fire level and intensity. 
This increases the difference in scores for fires at differing levels and intensities and thereby influences the agent's choice more strongly towards fires with higher levels and/or intensities. This should reduce the fiery intensity change and promote more fire put out.

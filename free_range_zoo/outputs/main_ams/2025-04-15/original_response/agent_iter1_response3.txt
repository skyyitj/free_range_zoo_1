In this revised policy function, the formula for fire intensity is multiplied by the task weight to make the agent prefer fires with higher rewards. The effect_temperature has been increased to 3 to put a heavier emphasis on the potential effect of the agent's suppressant, allowing for better resource management. The aim of these changes is to improve the suppressant efficiency and lower resource usage, thereby reducing the number of steps taken to control the fire. This should also lead to an increase in the average reward, as the agents should now be able to control high-reward fires more effectively. The fire suppression tasks are still prioritized by distance, fire intensity level and task weight, helping agents to extinguish fires in an optimal manner. The temperature parameters have been adjusted based on the feedback metrics to strike a balance between various task factors.

Based on the provided results and policy feedback, the system's average reward, while positive, could be further improved. The average fire intensity change is negative, indicating successful fire mitigation. However, the suppressant usage can be optimized. 

The average putout number (number of fires extinguished) could be improved, indicating that the policy function could be more effective in fire suppression. The burning number (number of uncontrolled fires) suggests that the agents are struggling to control the fires, which could be due to inefficient task assignments or suppressant allocation. burnout number also shows a similar trend. 

The policy function can be optimized by focusing on the distance to the fire, the potential impact of suppression, the intensity of the fire, and its level. Higher weight can be given to fires which are closer, can be suppressed substantially, and have a high intensity and level. This would lead to more efficient suppression, increasing the score and subsequently the reward.

Here's an updated implementation of the policy:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],  
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,  

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],  
    fire_levels: List[int],         
    fire_intensities: List[float],

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],           
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.2             
    level_temperature = 4.5     
    intensity_temperature = 2.0
    weight_temperature = 0.6
    effect_temperature = 0.5
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect/effect_temperature)
        scores.append(score)

    return np.argmax(scores)
```
This policy function revision aims to increase the agents' efficiency by heavily prioritizing the suppression of critical fires, as indicated by higher fire level, intensity, and potential suppression effect over mere closeness of the fire. The distance also becomes more relevant by lowering the dist_temperature. These changes should lead to more efficient fire suppression and optimal use of suppressant, thereby increasing the agents' rewards.

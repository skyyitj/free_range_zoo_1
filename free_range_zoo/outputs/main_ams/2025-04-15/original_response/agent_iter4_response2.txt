The evaluation results indicate a reasonable performance in extinguishing fires, given the relatively low burnout number and burning number. The suppressant efficiency is, however, not at an optimal level, suggesting that the suppressant might not be used most effectively.

Given that the total reward isn’t negative and the policy is generally on the right track, we don’t need to rewrite the entire policy function. Rather, some components can be optimized for better results.

Let's adjust temperatures related to the distances and effects, since changing these parameters can lead towards better suppressant efficiency. Increasing the dist_temperature parameter will give higher priority to closer fires, ensuring a more efficient allocation of resources. Similarly, reducing the effect_temperature can also help increase the suppressant efficiency as it will give a higher score to extinguishing fires where the agent's suppressant can be most effective.

Here is the updated policy:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float], 
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,  

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                     
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.2
    level_temperature = 4.0
    intensity_temperature = 1.5
    weight_temperature = 0.6
    effect_temperature = 0.4
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect/effect_temperature)
        scores.append(score)

    return np.argmax(scores)
```
These adjustments are expected to enhance the resource management and increase the suppressant efficiency. These changes also ensure the focus on fires that are closer and more controllable by the respective agent enhancing the overall suppressant efficiency and hopefully the efficiency at task control.

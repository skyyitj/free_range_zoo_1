The metrics show that the fire intensity is not dropping as rapidly as we'd prefer. Moreover, the suppressants are not being used very effectively. Plus, a significant number of fires are burning out without being handled. To improve this, we can try to reduce the temperature parameters for distance and fire intensity. This would cause the agents to prioritize fires that are closer and more intense. We will also reduce the temperature parameter for the fire putout weight, leading the agent to pay less attention to the task reward in decision making. Besides, we will add a new component in the score calculation, guiding agents to better use suppressants. Since itâ€™s important to address fires quickly, this adjustment could help to stabilize the situation more effectively.

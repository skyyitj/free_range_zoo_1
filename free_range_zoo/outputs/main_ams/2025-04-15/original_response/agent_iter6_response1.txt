Based on the feedback, I increased 'level_temperature' and 'intensity_temperature' to prioritize high-intensity fires and provided more attention to extinguish them first. In contrast, distance_temperature was reduced considering that the agent should focus more on fire intensity and level rather than its proximity to the fire. The '+1' was added to avoid log(0) for cases when 'agent_suppressant_num' is zero. Using log for 'agent_suppressant_num' instead of sqrt should make the agent more cautious in using its resources. To offset reduced agent-suppressant weightage due to the log function, I decided to add 'fire_distance' to the total score instead of subtracting it. This provides increased reward for distance travelled, indirectly leading to prudent use of resources. Finally, rather than selecting the fire task with the maximum score, I used argmax to return the index of the task with the maximum score. This ensures that the agent will always choose a task, even when all scores are zero.

In the revised policy function, I have increased the sensitivity to fire intensity (intensity_temperature from 0.15 to 0.25) as the Average Fire Intensity Change is negative which suggests that fires are not being extinguished efficiently. 

Furthermore, I have introduced a new variable extinguish_rate, which is the proportion of the current fire's intensity relative to the total intensity of all fires. This variable allows the agent to prioritize fires that are most intense relative to all fires. 

This new policy function also grants greater weight to agent_suppressant_num by using its square root, providing a further incentive for agents to conserve resources and use them more efficiently.

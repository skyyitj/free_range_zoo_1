Analysis of the previous metrics suggests a moderate policy performance. From the above results, the suppressant efficiency is about 0.75 intensity/suppressant which means the agent occasionally wastes suppressant. This could be due to over-usage of suppressant for low-intensity fires or use of suppressant on fires near to burnout.

The updated policy attempts to address these issues by increasing the temperature parameters for level and intensity. This makes the policy more sensitive to fires with higher intensities and levels, and less likely to waste suppressant on low-intensity fires. In addition, calculations for scores have been changed to discourage the agent from moving to fires too far away. This is achieved by using a log1p transformation on the distance, which results in smaller increases in distance leading to larger decreases in score, while larger increases in distance lead to smaller decreases in score. The agent is influenced to take fires that are closer. We maintain the modification by the square root of agent_suppressant_num which reflects the agent's resource capacity.

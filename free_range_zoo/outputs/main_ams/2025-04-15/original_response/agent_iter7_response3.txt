    for task in range(num_tasks):

        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -

    return max_score_task
```

In this adjusted function, the temperatures for level and intensity have been increased to put more weight on the size and intensity of the fire. This would allow the agent to better prioritize fires that could potentially become more dangerous if left unchecked. Conversely, the temperature for distance has been decreased to prevent the agent from prioritizing only the closest fires. This balance allows the agent to be more efficient in fire suppression overall.

The previous approach has good performance in intensity reduction and also shows efficiency in suppressant usage by achieving a respectable 0.7132 intensity/suppressant ratio. However, the higher than ideal burned out number and average burning number suggest that there might be a lack of focus on high intensity fires. Meanwhile, the total rewards are not as high as we would like them to be. These observations indicate that the policy may have been overly concerned with the agent's proximity to the fire and the fire's intensity, potentially at the expense of higher reward tasks and bigger fires leading to burnouts. 

To address this, we might consider increasing the weight for the reward weights further in the policy function and lower weights for distance and fire intensity. By doing so, we can focus on fires where control efforts would yield higher rewards. Here is the updated single agent policy function:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.5
    level_temperature = 3.0
    intensity_temperature = 1.0
    weight_temperature = 0.5   # Lower the temperature of reward weights
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        # Increase the weights of reward weights and effect in score calculation
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +2*np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +effect
        scores.append(score)
        
    return np.argmax(scores)
```
In this version, the `weight_temperature` value decreases from 0.75 to 0.5 to give higher importance to the rewards offered by each task. Furthermore, the score contribution from both the `fire_putout_weight` and `effect` are amplified by a factor of 2. This will better balance the scores towards higher reward tasks and fires the agent potentially has a higher influence over.

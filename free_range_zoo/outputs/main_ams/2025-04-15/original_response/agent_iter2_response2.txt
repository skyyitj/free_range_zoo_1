Reviewing the metric results:

The average rewards, at 14.10, is positive indicating that the policy function is working to some extent. However, the high average burning number and average burnedout number suggest that many fires are not being effectively managed. The high average used suppressant and relatively low average fire intensity change also suggest that the resources might not be used efficiently.

Based on these results, we can consider the following modifications to our policy function:

1. Increase the weight on remaining fires, to prioritize putting out fires that are about to burn out.
2. Decrease the weight on distances, to encourage agents to target nearer fires rather than spread out to cover all fires.
3. Increase the temperature parameter on suppressant efficiency, to encourage more efficient use of resources.

Here is the updated policy function:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)                    # Number of tasks
    scores = []                                  # Scores for each task
    
    # Temperature parameters for the exponential functions
    dist_temperature = 0.4
    level_temperature = 3.5
    intensity_temperature = 0.7
    weight_temperature = 1.0

    # Iterate over each task
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Calculate distance to fire
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        # Calculate potential effects of agent's suppressant on the fire intensity
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        # Calculate score based on distance, fire level and intensity, and task weight
        # Use exponential transformation for normalization and weighting, with negative scores for minimization
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +effect
        scores.append(score)
        
    # Return the task index with the highest score
    return np.argmax(scores)
```
This function increases the weighting of fire levels, calculating the distance with a smaller temperature, and adding up a higher suppressant efficiency. All of these modifications are aimed at improving resource efficiency and fire suppression effectiveness.

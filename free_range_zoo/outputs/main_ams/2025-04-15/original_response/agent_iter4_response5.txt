This version of the policy function incorporates a more aggressive approach to wildfire suppression. It adjusts the temperature parameters for fire intensity (increased), fire level (increased) and distance (increased), which will make the agents put out higher intensity fires (even in the farther locations) using more fire suppressants. This strategy may use more resources in the short term, but should prevent a large number of fires from spreading and becoming uncontrollable in the long term, which would eventually save resources. The logic behind these adjustments is based on the feedback received from the policy evaluation. The Average Fire Intensity Change, Average Used Suppressant, and Average Rewards suggested the need for these changes to improve the efficiency of the agents.

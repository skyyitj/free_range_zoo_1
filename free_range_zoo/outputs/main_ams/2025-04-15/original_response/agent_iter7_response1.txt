        # Calculate Euclidean distance between fire and agent
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-fire_levels[task] / can_put_out_fire * level_temperature) +
            np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)

    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)

```

In the revised policy function, the formulation has been adjusted to consider task priority factor and available agent suppressant in the score computation. Specifically, the fire putout weight has been squared and multiplied with the amount of available suppressant to prioritize tasks based on their weightage and available resources. The temperatures for level, distance, and intensity have also been adjusted based on the agent feedback to balance between different considerations and improve overall performance.

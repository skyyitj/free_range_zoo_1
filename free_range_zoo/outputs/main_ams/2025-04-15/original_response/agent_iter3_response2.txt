The results indicate that the number of total fires extinguished ("Putout Number") is relatively low. The average fire intensity change is negative but could be improved further. The suppressant usage is quite high, indicating that it might be used inefficiently or on fires that are not easily controlled. The amount of suppressant could be better allocated to fires that agents can feasibly extinguish or control.

Looking at our current policy function, we are already considering multiple factors such as fire distance, fire level, fire intensity, the potential effect, and task weight. However, the effects of these factors can be adjusted to improve performance. 

We could update the temperature parameters to attach more importance to the potential effect of an agent's suppressant on the fire. The allocation of suppressant should primarily aim at the fires where it can have the most significant effect. Therefore, we increase the weight for the suppression effect from 0.25 to 0.5. 

The updated policy function is:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,  

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                     
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.3
    level_temperature = 4.0
    intensity_temperature = 1.5
    weight_temperature = 0.6
    effect_temperature = 0.5
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect/effect_temperature)
        scores.append(score)

    return np.argmax(scores)
```
We hope these adjustments can lead to improvements in fire extinguishing and resource usage.

Looking into the values that we received, it seems that the "Fire Intensity Change" could be more negative, and we could use less of the "Suppressant" so we should adjust those variables in our policy.

The parameters that could be affecting those metrics, in this case, are "effect_temperature", "agent_distribution_temperature", and "dist_temperature".

1- We may increase the "effect_temperature" to strongly consider the potential effect that an agent can have on a fire, which would probably result in more fires being extinguished.
2- We could also reduce the "agent_distribution_temperature" to make the agent distribution over the fires more balanced, which would enable more fires to get handled.
3- Finally, we might increase the "dist_temperature", which gives a penalty to far fires, and as a result, agents can do more in a given time since they don't need to travel long distances. 

Let's make those modifications:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float, 
    agent_suppressant_num: float,  

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                     
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    scores = []
    
    dist_temperature = 0.6
    level_temperature = 4.0
    intensity_temperature = 1.5
    weight_temperature = 0.4
    effect_temperature = 0.6
    agent_distribution_temperature = 0.2
    
    # Calculate number of agents going to each fire
    agent_distribution = [(cdist([agent_pos], fire_pos).argmin()) for agent_pos in other_agents_pos]

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect/effect_temperature) \
                -np.exp(agent_distribution.count(i)/agent_distribution_temperature)

        scores.append(score)

    return np.argmax(scores)
```
These changes should result in more efficient suppressant use and a better handling of the fires.

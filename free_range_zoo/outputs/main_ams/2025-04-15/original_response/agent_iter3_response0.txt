From the feedback metrics, the agent is yet to efficiently extinguish fires while conserving resources. The intensity and spread of fires are reducing (Fire Intensity Change: -4.00), however, more fires are burning out without being controlled (Burnedout Number: 3.10), and we can try to use the suppressant more efficiently as well (Used Suppressant: 16.80).

To improve these metrics, the agent should prioritize fires that can be extinguished with limited resources. A new component in the score calculates the potential effect of the agent's suppressant on the fire intensity. Also, an attempt will be made to reduce the distance temperature to shift focus to closer fires, reduce level and intensity temperature, and elevate effect and weight temperature to pay more attention to reachable, higher priority fires and potential influences of agent's suppressant.

The new policy function looks like:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)                    # Number of tasks
    scores = []                                  # Scores for each task
    
    # Temperature parameters for the exponential functions
    dist_temperature = 0.15
    level_temperature = 2.0
    intensity_temperature = 0.625
    weight_temperature = 1.0
    effect_temperature = 2.0
    
    # Iterate over each task
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Calculate distance to fire
        dist = ((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)**0.5
        # Calculate potential effects of agent's suppressant on the fire intensity
        effect = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power / max(fire_intensities[i], 1)
        # Calculate score based on distance, fire level and intensity, and task weight
        # Use exponential transformation for normalization and weighting, with negative scores for minimization
        score = -np.exp(-dist/dist_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_levels[i]/level_temperature) \
                -np.exp(-fire_intensities[i]/intensity_temperature) \
                +np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i]/weight_temperature) \
                +np.exp(effect / effect_temperature)
        scores.append(score)
        
    # Return the task index with the highest score
    return np.argmax(scores)
```
This revised policy function will hopefully improve our metrics by extinguishing more fires while conserving resources and enhancing team collaboration.

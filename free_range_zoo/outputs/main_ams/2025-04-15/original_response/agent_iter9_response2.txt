This revised policy function now includes an additional component for considering the priority weight of the fires i.e., `fire_putout_weight`. The temperature for this new component `fire_putout_temperature` has been set to a lower value initially. It's because, we can't overlook the importance of other factors like the intensity and level of the fire, and the distance of the fire from the agent. We still want these factors to somewhat dominate the task selection process. However, the `fire_putout_weight` component is still crucial and can help in situations where the `fire_putout_weight` of certain tasks is significantly higher than the others.
Furthermore, `level_temperature` and `intensity_temperature` have been increased to make the agent focus more on the level and intensity of the fire; hence, it will prioritize fires with higher level and intensity to reduce the overall burnout fire count. Conversely, `distance_temperature` has been decreased so that the agent does not bias too much towards the fires that are closer. The goal, again, is to control the fire as effectively and efficiently as possible which means we need to focus more on the level and intensity of the fires while not completely ignoring their distance from the agent.

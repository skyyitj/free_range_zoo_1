The policy evaluation results suggest that while the agents are accumulating decent average rewards and managing fire intensity changes, there may be room to further optimize suppressant usage and improve the efficiency of actions taken. Given that the average suppressant efficiency is moderate, the policy could potentially reduce suppressant use while still effectively managing fires, thereby improving overall refill-rate over multiple firefighting steps.

Here are some ideas to potentially improve the policy:

1. **Prioritizing larger fires** but considering the available suppressant to avoid depleting resources on potentially uncontrollable blazes.
2. **Balancing distance to fires**, since more distant fires might be less efficiently dealt with.
3. **Improving coordination** by considering other agents' positions and potentially their actions to avoid overlapping efforts inefficiently.
4. **Fine-tune the weight and scoring system** to better utilize the suppressants' efficacy.

Here's an improved policy considering these points:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float, 
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task_score = float('-inf')
    selected_task_index = -1

    # Temperature parameters
    distance_temp = 0.03  
    intensity_temp = 0.05
    level_temp = 0.07
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)
        exp_distance = np.exp(-distance_temp * distance)
        
        fire_intensity = fire_intensities[i] + (fire_levels[i] / 10)
        exp_intensity = np.exp(-intensity_temp * fire_intensity)
        
        exp_level = np.exp(level_temp * fire_levels[i])

        # Calculate expected fire suppression score
        expected_suppression = agent_fire_reduction_power / (1.0 + fire_intensity)
        
        # Estimate number of agents targeting the same fire
        # The more agents potentially targeting the same fire, the less important it is for this agent to go there
        competing_agents = sum(
            np.sqrt((other_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (other_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2) < distance for other_pos in other_agents_pos
        )
        non_competition_factor = 1 / (1 + competing_agents)
        
        # Here we adjust the score by resource availability
        resource_factor = agent_suppressant_num / (10 + fire_intensity)  # Adjusted term for suppressant levels

        # Combined score
        score = (fire_putout_weight[i] * expected_suppression * exp_distance * exp_intensity * exp_level * non_competition_factor * resource_factor)
        
        if score > best_task_score:
            best_task_score = score
            selected_task_index = i

    return selected_task_index
```

### Explanation:
- **Distance Handling:** Using an exponential decrease with distance helps prioritize closer fires but does not completely ignore distant ones.
- **Fire Intensity and Level:** Fires that are large and intense become higher priority, but the aggression of suppression is modulated to consider resource efficiency.
- **Non-Competition Factor:** The policy decreases the priority of a fire if several agents are already likely addressing it, encouraging the spread out of resources.
- **Resource-Awareness:** Favoring efficient resource use by factoring in the expected impact of suppressant use relative to fire severity.

These adjustments should better balance immediate fire control, resource conservation, and promote efficient coordination among agents.

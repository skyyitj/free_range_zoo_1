Looking at the current results: 
- The reward value is positive which indicates that the agents are gaining some advantage from the current policy but there is room for improvements.
- The average fire intensity change is negative. This is a good signal as it indicates a decrease in fire intensity.
- The suppressant efficiency reflects fairly good utilization, but there might be further opportunities for efficiency through better resource allocation.
- Burning, putout, and burned-out numbers, although not provided for this scenario, are crucial and should be analyzed during the actual policy adjustments.

Analyzing these results, the policy may require adjustments in:

1. Prioritizing fires with higher intensities: Given that our suppressant efficiency is good, we could risk allocating more suppressant towards these fires.
2. Balancing distance consideration: Although the policy seems to be functioning well in terms of rewards and fire intensity change, it may be beneficial to look closer at fires which are nearer and not just higher priority ones.

Let's adjust the policy:

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task_score = float('-inf')
    selected_task_index = -1

    # Modifying temperatures and factors for policy tuning
    distance_temperature = 0.008  # Reduced impact of distance to allow more flexibility
    intensity_temperature = 0.03  # Increase to focus less aggressively on very high intensive fires
    suppressant_conserve_factor = 8.0  # Moderate emphasis on saving suppressant
    intensity_handle_factor = 2.5  # Increased contribution of handling higher fire intensities

    remaining_suppressant = agent_suppressant_num / 10 * np.exp(-suppressant_conserve_factor * (1.0 - (agent_suppressant_num / 10.0)))

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)
        norm_distance = np.exp(-distance_temperature * distance)

        intensity = fire_intensities[i] * fire_levels[i]
        norm_intensity = np.exp(-intensity_temperature * intensity * intensity_handle_factor)

        score = fire_putout_weight[i] * (norm_distance * agent_fire_reduction_power / (1 + intensity)) * np.log1p(fire_levels[i]) * remaining_suppressant * norm_intensity

        if score > best_task_score:
            best_task_score = score
            selected_task_index = i

    return selected_task_index
``` 

Explanation:
- **Distance Temperature**: Further reduction allow agents to manage targets slightly further away if those targets have higher priorities due to their intensity or reward.
- **Intensity Temperature**: The increase has been kept similar as we are looking to have the agents consider higher intensity fires.
- **Suppressant Conservation Factor**: A reduction in value might help agents use a bit more suppressant.
- **Intensity Handle Factor**: Increasing this value will allocate a larger consideration to handle higher intensity fires in the score calculation.

The adjustments focus on creating a better suppression spread across fires by better allocation of the fire suppressants, and intensifying the suppression effect on intense fires. This should serve to increase overall performance by reducing more fire intensity, providing better allocation of resources, and increasing the reward gained.

Analyzing the Evaluation Metrics:
1. **Average Rewards**: The reward metric is moderately high, indicating good overall performance, but there might be room for improvement to push this even higher.
2. **Average Fire Intensity Change**: The negative value indicates that the fires are being reduced in intensity which is desired, yet the magnitude suggests there's potential for more efficient fire handling.
3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency**: This metric is close to 1, indicating efficient use of resources. It might be fine-tuned slightly to optimize the use of suppressants further while maintaining effectiveness in controlling fires.

From the metrics, it's inferred that while the overall strategy is working to some extent, there are areas where the efficiency could be improved, particularly in balancing resource use with fire mitigation tasks. Additionally, further optimization might target increasing the intensity reduction rate without drastically increasing suppressant usage.

Revised Policy Function Strategy:
- Tune the evaluation of fire intensity and the agent's proximity to the fires to improve reward maximisation and resource management.
- Implement a slightly more aggressive stance on high-intensity fires that pose a larger threat or carry larger rewards.
- Further optimize suppressant usage by taking into account the overall fire intensity over all locations.

Revised Policy Function:
```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task_score = float('-inf')
    selected_task_index = -1

    # Adjusted temperature parameters
    distance_temperature = 0.001  # Reduced to prioritize distant high-weight fires
    intensity_temperature = 0.01  # Slightly reduce impact of intensity
    reward_scale = 10  # Scaling up rewards significance in decisions
    suppressant_factor = 10.0  # Encourage conserving suppressants slightly less aggressively

    normalized_suppressant_usage = np.exp(-suppressant_factor * (1 - agent_suppressant_num / 10))
    
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)
        norm_distance = np.exp(-distance_temperature * distance)
        
        # Complex function to evaluate task attractiveness based on fire intensity, rewards, and resources
        intensity = fire_intensities[i] * fire_levels[i]
        norm_intensity = np.exp(-intensity_temperature * intensity)
        
        # Include reward_weight more significantly into consideration
        score = (fire_putout_weight[i] * reward_scale) * (norm_distance * agent_fire_reduction_power / (1 + intensity)) * np.log1p(fire_levels[i]) * normalized_suppressant_usage * norm_intensity
        
        if score > best_task_score:
            best_task_score = score
            selected_task_index = i

    return selected_task_index
```

This revision introduces tighter control on resource usage balancing heightened responsiveness to intensively burning fires, alongside a stronger consideration for the weighted rewards associated with different fire tasks. The revised policy less aggressively conserves suppressants to permit more aggressive fire fighting where needed, aiming for a better-controlled reduction in fire intensity, and thus improving the overall performance.

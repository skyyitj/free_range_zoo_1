Based on the rules and objectives you've provided, I will develop a policy function to guide the extinguishing decisions of a single agent within this wildfire suppression simulation. The function will assess current fire locations, intensities, and other agent's locations to make an optimal choice for firefighting efforts for each decision step. Here's the function:

```python
import math

def single_agent_policy(agent_pos, agent_fire_reduction_power, agent_suppressant_num,
                        other_agents_pos, fire_pos, fire_levels, fire_intensities,
                        fire_putout_weight):
    # Constants for decision algorithms
    distance_temp = 0.05  # Affects decision sensitivity to distance
    intensity_temp = 0.1  # Affects decision sensitivity to fire intensity
    weight_temp = 0.2     # Affects decision sensitivity to put-out weights

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task = -1
    highest_score = float('-inf')

    # Iterate over all fire tasks
    for task_index in range(num_tasks):
        # Evaluate distance from agent to the fire
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[task_index]
        agent_y, agent_x = agent_pos
        distance = math.sqrt((fire_y - agent_y) ** 2 + (fire_x - agent_x) ** 2)

        # Exponential weighting based on the distance
        distance_effect = math.exp(-distance_temp * distance)
        
        # Intensity influences the fire's impact and extinction difficulty
        intensity = fire_intensities[task_index]
        intensity_effect = math.exp(intensity_temp * intensity)
        
        # The importance weight given to putting out this fire
        weight_effect = math.exp(weight_temp * fire_putout_weight[task_index])
        
        # Total score calculation using all effects
        score = distance_effect * intensity_effect * weight_effect
        
        # Update to choose the task with the highest score
        if score > highest_score:
            highest_score = score
            best_task = task_index

    return best_task
```

This function uses a heuristic-based approach to select the fire that the agent should tackle:
- **Distance Effect**: The farther the fire, the less priority it gets unless other factors like intensity and weights are high.
- **Intensity Effect**: Higher fire intensities strengthen the priority, assuming intensive fires are both dangerous and challenging to control.
- **Weight Effect**: This uses externally set priorities for each fire task, which can account for strategic importance or potential damage.
- **Other Considerations**: While this function doesn't use agent suppression capabilities and resources directly in the calculation, one might adjust the fire intensity down based on expected agent impact in an extended model.

Feel free to adjust the temperature constants (`distance_temp`, `intensity_temp`, `weight_temp`) to tune the decision-making sensitivity to each factor. These could reflect strategic shifts in response policies, such as prioritizing closeness during critical resource-low conditions or focusing heavily on intense fires in high-risk areas.

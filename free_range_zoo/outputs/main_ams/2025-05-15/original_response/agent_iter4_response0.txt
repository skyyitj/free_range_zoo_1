The average fire intensity change and suppressant efficiency seem to be satisfactory from these results. However, the rewards are not as high as expected. We also need to incentivize avoiding fire burnouts, given that the burned-out number is non-zero. To accomplish these, we could further emphasize the importance of reward weight in the policy and introduce a penalty for enabling fire burnouts which could mean a fire burning more intensely than the current agent fire reducing power. In addition, the temperature parameters could be fine-tuned to achieve a balance for optimal performance.

Here is the updated policy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task_score = float('-inf')
    selected_task_index = -1

    # Temperature adjustments for policy tuning
    distance_temperature = 0.009  # Lower to allow more flexibility
    intensity_temperature = 0.017  # Lower slightly to handle intense fires more strategically
    suppressant_conserve_factor = 11.0  # Even more emphasis on saving suppressant
    reward_weight_focus = 3.0  # Increased to focus more on higher-reward tasks
    burnout_penalty = 5.0  # Introduce a penalty for enabling fire burnouts

    # Normalize the suppressant factor: encourage saving suppressant for situations with more intense fires
    remaining_suppressant = np.exp(-suppressant_conserve_factor * (1 - (agent_suppressant_num / 10)))

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)
        norm_distance = np.exp(-distance_temperature * distance)

        intensity = fire_intensities[i] * fire_levels[i]
        norm_intensity = np.exp(-intensity_temperature * intensity)

        # Reward weight enhancement: larger weight leads to more focus on high-reward tasks
        reward_focus = np.exp(reward_weight_focus * fire_putout_weight[i])
        
        # Burnout penalty: larger penalty for fires too intense for an agent to handle
        fire_burnout_penalty = np.exp(-burnout_penalty * (intensity / agent_fire_reduction_power))

        # Adjust score to include higher priorities on larger reward tasks and avoid fire burnouts
        score = reward_focus * (norm_distance * agent_fire_reduction_power / (1 + intensity)) * np.log1p(fire_levels[i]) * remaining_suppressant * norm_intensity * fire_burnout_penalty

        if score > best_task_score:
            best_task_score = score
            selected_task_index = i

    return selected_task_index
```

Explanation:
- **Reward Focus**: An exponential function dependent on reward weights is introduced, which significantly escalates the importance of tasks with higher associated rewards.
- **Burnout Penalty**: Employing a dynamic penalty discourages agents from undertaking fires too difficult for them to handle effectively. This should lessen the occurrence of fire burnouts.
- **Temperature Adjustments**: Values are fine-tuned to meet performance expectations better.

This updated policy encourages more strategic firefighting decisions centered around maximizing rewards and avoiding burnouts while ensuring more optimal resource management. The suppressant conservation factor ensures the agent does not run out of resources quickly, increasing their ability to continue fighting fires for longer periods.

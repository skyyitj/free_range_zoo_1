Based on the evaluation results, let's consider possible adjustments to improve the policy:

1. **Average Fire Intensity Change**: The negative value of -0.84 is good as it indicates a reduction in fire intensity. However, to further enhance the effectiveness, the policy could place a greater emphasis on tasks involving higher fire levels.

2. **Used Suppressant**: Although not directly reported, its efficiency is closely related to "Suppressant Efficiency". High suppressant efficiency is good, but we would want both high efficiency and minimal usage.

3. **Steps, Putout Number, and Burning Number**: These weren't explicitly reported in the latest results. Too many steps could imply inefficiency, and too many burning or unhandled fires could imply misprioritization.

To address the above points, the revised policy could:
- Further increase the penalty for distance to discourage wasting resources on far-away fires unless strictly necessary.
- Place even greater emphasis on fire levels, especially if they approach a critical threshold.
- Consider a ratio of intensity reduction to suppressant cost to optimize resource use.

Revised policy implementation:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    best_task_score = float('-inf')
    selected_task_index = -1

    # Hyperparameters tweaked for balance
    distance_temperature = 0.01  # Increased the impact of distance
    intensity_temperature = 0.015  # Moderate sensitivity towards fire intensity
    suppressant_conserve_factor = 25.0  # Strong encouragement for suppressant conservation
    reward_scale = 2.0  # Highlighting reward significance

    remaining_suppressant = np.exp(-suppressant_conserve_factor * (1 - (agent_suppressant_num / 10)))

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        distance = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0])**2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1])**2)
        norm_distance = np.exp(-distance_temperature * distance)

        intensity = fire_intensities[i] * fire_levels[i]
        norm_intensity = np.exp(-intensity_temperature * intensity)

        score = reward_scale * fire_putout_weight[i] * (norm_distance * agent_fire_reduction_power / (1 + intensity)) * np.log1p(fire_levels[i]) * remaining_suppressant * norm_intensity

        if score > best_task_score:
            best_task_score = score
            selected_task_index = i

    return selected_task_index
```

### Further Considerations:
- The increased `distance_temperature` will make agents more sensitive to distance, ensuring nearby fires are prioritized unless distant fires have significantly higher weights.
- Enhanced `intensity_temperature` and `suppressant_conserve_factor` will motivate effective firefighting while conserving resources, benefiting both efficiency and sustainability in fire suppression efforts.

This revision aims to adapt policy factors to a more performance-driving model, optimizing fire control while maximizing operational efficiency and resource usage.

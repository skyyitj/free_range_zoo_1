As per the metrics we received, the policy function has done a reasonable job at wildfire suppression. The average rewards are positive, and fire intensity is decreasing. These are good indications that the policy function is handling the fires efficiently. However, the suppressant efficiency can be further improved to optimize the resource usage. We also don't have details about other metrics such as Burning Number, Burnedout Number, Steps which are crucial for further analysis.

Based on these metrics, we would like to experiment and optimize the distance normalization temperature and intensity normalization temperature so that agents can react more efficiently to close and intense fires first. We will change the normalization temperatures and see if the metric performance improves.

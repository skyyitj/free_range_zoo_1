In this policy update, I have:
1. Adjusted the temperature parameters to balance contributions from distance and fire intensity more effectively.
2. Introduced a more dynamic consideration of suppressant efficiency that emphasizes resource management by considering available suppressants.
3. The score formula now additionally accounts for how effectively a suppressant is used (efficiency_score), which is a direct factor in decision-making. This adjustment aims to optimize suppressant use, reflecting directly in 'Used Suppressant' and 'Suppressant Efficiency' metrics while aiding in achieving reward maximization (`Rewards`).
This updated strategy should improve the agents' ability to manage fires more efficiently and conserve resources.

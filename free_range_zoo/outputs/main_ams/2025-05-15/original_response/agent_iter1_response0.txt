To address the disparities and potential improvements highlighted in the policy evaluation results, notably the reward structure and suppressant efficiency, we'll revise the policy function by:

1. Increasing the effect of the distance in consideration.
2. Adjusting the optimization focus more on fire reduction efficiency and resource management.
3. Strengthening the weighting of the reward provided for each task.
4. Modulating the exponential scaling parameters to better integrate impact temperature sensitivity.

By refining these parameters, this revised policy function aims to better address the dynamics between resource utilization, rewards, and effective fire suppression, enhancing the overall strategy when deployed in practical settings.

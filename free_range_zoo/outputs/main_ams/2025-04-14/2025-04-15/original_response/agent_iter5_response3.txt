Let's examine each of the metrics in order and consider how we could improve them.

Average Burning Number: 3.61
While this is not alarmingly high, the burning number could still be reduced. This means the agents are not managing to put out enough fires. Prioritizing the suppression of major fires might be helpful.

Average Putout Number: 1.50
This number is relatively low, indicating that the agents are not effectively extinguishing the fires. A better task prioritization might improve this metric.

Average Burnedout Number: 1.10
While this is not high, it can still be improved. This indicates that some fires burnout by themselves before the agents extinguish them, which should not be the norm.

Average Fire Intensity Change: -4.00
This is a good sign as it means the fire intensities are generally decreasing.

Average Used Suppressant: 10.00
The less suppressant the agents use per step, the better it will be in the long run.

Average Steps: 5.60
Lowering the number of steps taken to reach a fire could improve the efficiency of the suppression efforts and decrease the overall suppressant used.

Average Rewards: 14.10
The rewards are positive, which indicates that the agents are doing a good job, but there is still room for improvement.

Average Fire Intensity Change: -1.06
The negative fire intensity change means the agents are making progress in handling the fires.

Average Used Suppressant Number: 0.00
This shows that there is no suppressant left, which may suggest that the agents are using up all their resources too quickly. Improving resource allocation could help make more efficient use of the suppressant.

Average Suppressant Efficiency: 0.6800 intensity/suppressant
This shows that the agent is not using the suppressant effectively to decrease the fire's intensity. Hence, focusing on larger and more intense fires might improve this metric.

Given the analysis of the metrics, the main areas for improvement are the fire extinguishing efficiency, resource allocation, and task prioritization. Based on this, here comes the revised policy function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial import distance

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)

    # calculate suppression power and the score for each task
    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    # Adjusted temperature parameters
    level_temperature = 0.25
    intensity_temperature = 0.15
    distance_temperature = 0.01

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        # get euclidean distance between fire and agent
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        # calculate score for each task using fire intensity, level, and distance
        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-fire_levels[task] * level_temperature) +
            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] * intensity_temperature) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        ) * fire_putout_weight[task]

    # return the index of the task with the highest score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```

These revisions reduce the level_temperature so as to prioritize larger fires more, raise the intensity_temperature to improve the use of suppression resources and lower the distance_temperature to encourage agents to treat nearer fires first. This should lead to an increment in the overall efficiency and the suppressant's utilization, decrease the burning and burnedout numbers and increase the putout number and the total reward.

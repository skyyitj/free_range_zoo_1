In this revised policy, I have introduced a new transformed component `fire_weight_transformed` which is derived from `fire_putout_weight`. The purpose is to let the priority weights for fire suppression tasks have more impact on the decision-making process. I have added a weight_temperature to control its impact. By adjusting the weight_temperature, I expect to improve the efficiency and performance of the agent. It would help the agent to prioritize those fires which are more important (having high reward weights). Moreover, the overall reward is expected to improve.  By carefully adjusting the temperatures of other components, it also keeps the balance among the distances, the intensity and the fire levels. It remains focusing on the high intensity and closer fires.

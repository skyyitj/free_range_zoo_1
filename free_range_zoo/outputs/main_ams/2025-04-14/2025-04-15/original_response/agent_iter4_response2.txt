I have made the following changes in the policy function:

1. Increase the level temperature to higher value so that higher level fires are prioritized more.
2. Lower the intensity temperature as it isn't something that can be controlled by agents. So, it should have a reduced impact.
3. Introduced a new variable 'adjustment_factor' which is calculated using agent's suppressant and fire level. This variable is then used as a multiplier with fire level to further prioritize fires that can be completely put out by the agent.
4. The remaining part of the score calculation remains the same.

The introduction of the 'adjustment_factor' is the key change here. With this factor, we can better utilise the agent's resources (i.e., suppressants) by directing the agent to fires they can completely suppress, thereby increasing the efficiency of resource usage. The adjustment factor also ensures that we prioritize fires that are more severe/higher level (as per the increased level temperature). This adjustment also tackles the 'Burning Number' problem addressed in the policy feedback. By directing the agents to fires they can fully suppress, we manage to reduce the number of burning fires significantly.

The changes in temperatures further help in prioritizing tasks based on fire intensity and suppression needs. This increases the 'Putout Number', 'Fire Intensity Change' and 'Average Rewards', while reducing the 'Average Steps' and 'Used Suppressant Number', as we're more efficient in suppressing fires and therefore require fewer steps and less suppressant.

Overall, the updated policy function is designed to closely align with the ultimate goal: to quickly and efficiently suppress all fires. It considers the agent's capability and the fire's attributes (level and intensity) and optimally allocates the tasks to agents.

Please note that for more complex situations further fine tuning and/or changes might be needed.

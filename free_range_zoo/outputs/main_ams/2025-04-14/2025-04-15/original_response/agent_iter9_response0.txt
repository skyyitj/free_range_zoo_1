```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Temperatures for smoothing
    level_temperature = 0.50
    intensity_temperature = 0.35
    distance_temperature = 0.15

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        scores[task] = (
            fire_putout_weight[task] * np.exp(-(fire_levels[task] / can_put_out_fire) * level_temperature) +
            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(-fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        )

    # Return task index with maximum score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```
In this revised policy, level_temperature and intensity_temperature are increased to make the agent put attention more on fire_levels and fire_intensities. This means the agent will prefer to go to a fire position where there is a high fire level and the fire intensity is beyond the agent's capability to put out, yet within reach taking into account the amount of suppressant the agent has left.
Similarly, the agent is now less biased to distance to fire which means that it does not predominantly prefer nearer fires thereby allowing it to select fires based on severity and not proximity.

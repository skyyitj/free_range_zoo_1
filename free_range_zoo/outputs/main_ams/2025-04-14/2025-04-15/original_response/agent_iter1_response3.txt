We can observe several things from our metrics:

1. The number of fires successfully extinguished (`Putout Number`) is lower than the number of fires that remain unhandled (`Burning Number`). This means the agent's fire-fighting efforts are not sufficient.

2. The amount of suppressant used (`Used Suppressant`) is high, while the reduction in fire intensity (`Fire Intensity Change`) is low. This implies inefficiencies in suppressant usage.

3. `Suppressant Efficiency` is also low, which confirms the above points.

4. Finally, the `Burnedout Number` metric shows that fires are being left to burn out instead of being extinguished by agents, which is a challenge that needs to be addressed.

Considering these points, we can keep the structure of our policy function, but we need to adjust the parameters. We can decrease the `level_temperature` and `intensity_temperature` to place more emphasis on the intensity and level of fires. This will lead to a more aggressive approach in extinguishing fires and motivate the agent to use suppressant more effectively. We also need to increase the `distance_temperature`, so agents would prefer nearby tasks and would save more suppressants to handle the closest tasks.

Revised policy function will be:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple
from scipy.spatial import distance

def revised_single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:
  
    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    # adjusted temperature parameters for policy improvement:
    level_temperature = 0.01
    intensity_temperature = 0.01
    distance_temperature = 0.02

    for task in range(num_tasks):
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])
        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-fire_levels[task] * level_temperature) +
            np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)) * fire_putout_weight[task]
        
    return np.argmax(scores)
```
This function was improved to increase both the `Putout Number` and `Suppressant Efficiency`, and to decrease the `Burning Number` and `Used Suppressant` metrics.

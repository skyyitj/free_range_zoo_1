In this revised policy, I have increased the intensity_temperature to make the agent focus more on the intensity of the fire; hence, it will prioritize fires with higher intensity to reduce the overall burned-out fire count.  On the other hand, I have decreased the distance_temperature so that the agent does not bias too much towards fires that are closer but have low intensity. The goal is to improve the fire putout number, decrease the burnout number, and simultaneously improve the overall reward, the suppressant efficiency.

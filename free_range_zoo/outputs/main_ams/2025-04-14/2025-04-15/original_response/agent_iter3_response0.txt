Revised Policy:

Based on the evaluation results, I'll make the following adjustments to the policy function:

1. Increase the importance of fire intensity reduction: the policy is not fully efficient at reducing fire intensities.
To improve this, I'll increase the temperature parameter for fire intensity in calculating the task score. It will prioritize tasks that can yield a larger reduction in fire intensity.

2. Improve suppressant efficiency: it seems like we're depleting resources rather quickly. 
To make our suppressant last longer, I'll reduce the direct influence of 'fire_putout_weight' in score calculation. This will ensure agents don't rush to extinguish fires with larger rewards but higher suppressant cost.

3. Increase the urgency of near fires: looking at the burning and burnt-out numbers, agents seem to be missing nearby threats. 
I'll add a larger penalty for distant fires to make sure agents take care of imminent dangers first.
 
Let's implement these changes:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    
    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Adjusted temperature parameters
    level_temperature = 0.2
    intensity_temperature = 0.1  # increased
    distance_temperature = 0.05  # increased

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        # get euclidean distance between fire and agent
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        # calculate score for each task using fire intensity, level, and distance
        # reduced the direct influence of 'fire_putout_weight' on score
        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-fire_levels[task] * level_temperature) +
            np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        ) * np.sqrt(fire_putout_weight[task])

    # return the index of the task with the highest score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```
Please execute this revised policy function and provide new performance feedback.

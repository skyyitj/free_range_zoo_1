From the evaluation results, it is clear that our policy function currently has room for improvement. Specifically, the metrics indicate that while the agents are managing to reduce fire intensity and influence some fires, there are still too many fires burning or burning out unaddressed. Additionally, the suppressant efficiency and resources consumed can be optimized further.

Keeping these observations in mind, let's adjust the policy function:

We could consider adjusting the temperature parameters to change the influence of fire level, fire intensity, and distance on the decision-making process. For example, increasing the `fire_distance` temperature will make the agent favor tasks near its location. This would also increase efficiency in using suppressant.

Another potential adjustment is to the way we calculate the task scores. For example, we could multiply the distance and suppression amount factor together, to put a higher penalty when agent resources are low or when the fire is too far.

Another tactic might be to adjust the `suppressant_amount` calculation. We could divide  suppressant amount by fire intensity to further penalize taking on high intensity fires when resources are low.

Let's implement these changes:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Adjusted temperature parameters
    level_temperature = 0.15
    intensity_temperature = 0.07
    distance_temperature = 0.04

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        # get euclidean distance between fire and agent
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        effective_suppressant_amount = can_put_out_fire / (fire_distance + 1)

        # modified score calculation
        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-fire_levels[task] * level_temperature) +
            np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / effective_suppressant_amount * intensity_temperature) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        ) * fire_putout_weight[task]

    # return the index of the task with the highest score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```
With these adjustments, we are hoping to reduce the number of burning and burned-out fires, and to improve the suppressant efficiency and rewards.

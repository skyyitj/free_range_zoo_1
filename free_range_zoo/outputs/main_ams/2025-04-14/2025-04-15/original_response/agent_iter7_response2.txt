Based on the feedback, the values for most metrics are not satisfying, meaning that the current policy function isn't accomplishing the task goal well. The 'Average Burning Number' is much higher than 'Average Putout Number', indicating that too many fires remain unhandled, while few are successfully extinguished. Also, 'Average Suppressant Efficiency' is relatively low, implying suppressant isn't used efficiently to reduce fire intensities. We need to revise our policy function to put out fires more efficiently and accurately.

Now looking at the policy function, our agent may not be able to distinguish between the suppression tasks effectively. We have assigned weights to the tasks based mainly on the distance, minimum intensity, and agent capability, but we also need to consider other aspects. For example, the chance of extinguishing each fire considering the fire intensity at the location and the agent's suppressant resources.

Also, the choice of the temperatures for the different components in our policy with significant focus on the distance might be diverting our agent from more important fires that are slightly farther away. It would be interesting to experiment with other temperature scales for intensity and level, that might encourage the agent to target more intense fires. 

Let's revise the policy function:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple
from scipy.spatial import distance

def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # Fire suppression power
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Fire suppressant resources

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Positions of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value for each fire

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for suppression tasks
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)

    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Adjusted Temperatures
    level_temperature = 0.45
    intensity_temperature = 0.35
    distance_temperature = 0.10

    for task in range(num_tasks):

        # Calculate Euclidean distance between fire and agent
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(-(fire_levels[task] / can_put_out_fire) * level_temperature) +
            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(-fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * intensity_temperature) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(fire_distance * distance_temperature)
        ) * fire_putout_weight[task]

    # Return task index with maximum score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task    
```
We've lowered down the temperature for the distance and increased the temperatures for the fire intensity and level, to help our agent target more intense fires. Also, we've removed the part where the distances are normalized by agent's suppressant.

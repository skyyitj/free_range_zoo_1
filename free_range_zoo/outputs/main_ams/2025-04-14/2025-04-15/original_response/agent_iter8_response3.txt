Let's think step by step through the problem:

- "Average Burning Number" is quite high, indicating that there are fires that agents are not able to address. This is due to the fact that not all fires are dealt with and reduce overall rewards.
- "Average Burnedout Number" is also not satisfying, suggesting that there are many fires that burn out without being handled, which penalizes the agents.
- Despite the fact that the "Average Suppressant Efficiency" is not bad, it could be improved.
- The "Average Fire Intensity Change" metric is negative, which is good as it shows that fire intensity is being reduced over time.
- However, the "Average Rewards" could be improved. 

The policy is indeed putting out fires and accumulating rewards, but not as optimal. Also suppressant must be used more efficiently. Let's make the following changes:

1. Prioritize fires that other agents are not near to ensure that all fires are being addressed and reduce the "Average Burning Number".
2. Consider the amount of suppressant remaining in the scoring function to encourage efficient use of resources.
3. Adjust the temperature parameters to balance the impact of distance, fire intensity, and resource availability on the task selection. 

With these changes, the new policy function could look like this:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float]
) -> int:

    num_tasks = len(fire_levels)
    scores = np.zeros(num_tasks)
    can_put_out_fire = agent_suppressant_num * agent_fire_reduction_power

    # Temperatures
    other_agents_distance_temp = 0.2
    level_temp = 0.6
    intensity_temp = 0.3
    distance_temp = 0.4
    agent_suppressant_temp = 0.4

    for task in range(num_tasks):
        min_other_agent_distance = min([distance.euclidean(other_agent_pos, fire_pos[task]) for other_agent_pos in other_agents_pos])
        fire_distance = distance.euclidean(agent_pos, fire_pos[task])

        scores[task] = (
            np.exp(other_agents_distance_temp * min_other_agent_distance) +
            (fire_putout_weight[task]) * np.exp((fire_levels[task] / can_put_out_fire) * -level_temp) +
            can_put_out_fire * np.exp(fire_intensities[task] / can_put_out_fire * -intensity_temp) -
            fire_distance * np.exp(fire_distance * -distance_temp) +
            (agent_suppressant_num / fire_levels[task]) * np.exp((fire_levels[task] / agent_suppressant_num) * agent_suppressant_temp)
        )

    # Return task index with maximum score
    max_score_task = np.argmax(scores)
    return max_score_task
```

By taking into account the proximity of other agents, prioritizing fires that are further away from other agents should result in a better coverage of all fires. Modulating the scoring function with the remaining suppressant resources for each agent gives us the "Average Burning Number", "Average Burnedout Number", "Average Suppressant Efficiency" and "Average Rewards" we're looking for.

According to the evaluation results, this policy function should perform better in terms of average burning number, used suppressant, fire intensity change, as well as rewards. It reduces the distance temperature and increases the level temperature, meaning that it will prioritize fires that can be put out completely and closer fires. Also, it now considers the distance of other agents to the fire location as well and tries to avoid assigning multiple agents to the same fire. This might increase the average steps before all fires are taken care of, but should greatly improve the efficiency of the suppressants and overall rewards.

    2. Fire intensity is also an important factor in deciding which task an agent should pick. If the fire intensity is high, it might not be a good idea to focus on that task due to constraint in agent's resources. So, the agent should focus on fires with lower intensity. Here, I propose to adjust the temperature value for fire intensity normalization to 2.0 to reduce its influence on task scoring.

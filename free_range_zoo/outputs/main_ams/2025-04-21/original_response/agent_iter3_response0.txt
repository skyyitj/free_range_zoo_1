Based on the policy feedback, the agents perform well on average in terms of the steps taken to complete the task. However, their resource consumption seems to be high, this can be improved. Furthermore, as we see that Average Burnedout Number > Average Putout Number, agents are not efficient enough to control fire, there is a lot of room for improvement here. I would therefore consider the following:
1. Adjusting the temperature scale parameter higher for distance (`distance_temp`). This is mainly to make sure that agents are giving more priority to closer fires which are easier to reach and suppress.
2. Additionally, I would also like to penalize choosing fires that have a high intensity by reducing the `intensity_temp`.
3. Considering the high usage of the suppressant, I would like to make agents more cautious in resource allocation by increasing the weight for `agent_suppressant_num`.

Here is the modified policy function:
```python
def single_agent_policy(
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,
    agent_suppressant_num: float,
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],
    fire_levels: List[int],
    fire_intensities: List[float],
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],
) -> int:
    num_fires = len(fire_pos)

    # Adjusting temperature variables based on the policy evaluation feedback
    distance_temp = 0.2  # high value to favor closer fire.
    intensity_temp = 1  # low value to penalize higher intensity fire.
    weight_temp = 2

    task_scores = []
    for i in range(num_fires):

        # Calculate Euclidean distance to the fire
        distance = math.sqrt(
            (agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0]) ** 2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1]) ** 2
        )
        # Normalize distance using exponential function
        exp_distance = np.exp(-distance / distance_temp)
        
        # Normalize fire intensity
        exp_intensity = np.exp(-fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temp)
        
        # Consider fire's priority weight
        exp_weight = np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / weight_temp)

        # Calculate task score
        # Increasing the weight for remaining suppressant to 2
        task_score = (
            exp_distance * exp_intensity * exp_weight * (2 + agent_suppressant_num)
        )
        task_scores.append(task_score)

    # Return the index of the fire task with maximum score
    return task_scores.index(max(task_scores))
``` 
Such modification to our policy function will guide our agents to be more efficient in resource allocation and fire control.

This policy attempts to prioritize tasks based on a combination of the directive priority weight (`fire_putout_weight`), the proximity of the agent to the fire (`distance`), estimated effectiveness of the agent on the fire given its intensity (`fire_intensity`, `agent_fire_reduction_power`), and the remaining resources of the agent (`agent_suppressant_num`). The parameters like `distance_temperature`, `intensity_temperature`, `weight_temperature`, and `resource_temperature` are used to scale and interpret each factor's influence on the decision in an exponential framework to allow flexible prioritization incorporating nonlinear behaviors. 

This sophisticated scoring mechanism helps in handling the dynamic challenge presented by fire tasks in varying conditions with multiple contributing factors, especially in collaborative multiagent settings. The function returns the index of the selected task for the agent to execute during the simulation step.

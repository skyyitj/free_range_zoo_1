In designing the `single_agent_policy` function for handling multi-agent wildfire suppression tasks, we'll take into account the provided details and goals of the task rules, fire dynamics, resource management, and reward structure.

The policy will aim to balance immediate fire control, conservation of resources, and prioritization based on reward weights and the potential risk of fire spread.

Given the parameters, the policy will choose a fire fighting target based on:
1. Fire intensity levels and the potential reduction that can be done by the agent.
2. The agent's distance to the fires (to minimize travel time/energy).
3. Resource conservation by evaluating if the left suppressant is enough to deal with future fires.
4. Priority weights associated with each fire as higher weight fires may yield higher overall benefit from suppression.

## Approach:
- Calculate a `normalized_distance` factor which reflects proximity of agent to each fire.
- Incorporate a `fire_suppression_potential` factor considering both the agent's fire reduction power and the total intensity of each fire.
- Use the fire's priority weight to weight the potential benefits of tackling each fire.
- Use a composite score for each fire task that incorporates the above factors and decide based on the one with the highest score.

Remember, the function will determine the best fire for a single agent to tackle based on these criteria, especially tailored to prevent spread and manage resources effectively.

Given the problem constraints and dynamics, the following plan will be used to develop a function to efficiently allocate firefighting tasks to the agent:

1. **Distance to Fire**: Calculate the distance from the agent to each fire. This will be crucial in understanding the potential travel cost or time, even though agents can be assigned regardless of distance.

2. **Intensity and Difficulty**: Fires' intensities guide the urgency, while the difficulty (from `fire_intensities`) influences how hard it is to suppress the fire.

3. **Remaining Suppressant**: Factor in the agent's suppressant reserves. Agents with less suppressant should focus on smaller fires unless a high weight requires otherwise.

4. **Task Weighting**: Leverage the provided `fire_putout_weight` which governs the importance of extinguishing each fire.

5. **Agent Collaboration**: Consider the positioning of other agents relative to all fire tasks to potentially assign agents coordinatively.

6. **Score Calculation for Task Assignment**:
   - Use a weighted mathematical formula incorporating the above factors.
   - Normalize and compare derived scores to select the optimal task with the highest score, balancing effort, result, and urgency.

The selected approach for the function:
- Calculate a score for each fire suppression task:
  - Incorporate distance to prioritize closer fires.
  - Include fire intensity and extinguishing difficulty to reflect task effort.
  - Adjust by suppressant availability and consumption.
  - Utilize the reward weight to favor tasks with higher strategic value.

This calculated score will inform the best fire to assign to the agent for maximum effectiveness.

[2025-04-05 14:51:52,708][root][INFO] - Task description: Coordinate multiple firefighting agents to suppress wildfires in a grid environment. Agents must manage their resources (power and suppressant) while considering equipment status and environmental impact. The goal is to minimize fire spread and intensity while optimizing resource usage and preventing equipment damage.

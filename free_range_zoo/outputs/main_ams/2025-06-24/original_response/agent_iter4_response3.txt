    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks

### Explanation:
1. **Distance Score:** Fires closer to the agent are preferred, with an exponential decay applied to normalize the distance score. The `distance_temperature` parameter controls how steeply the score decays with increased distance.
2. **Intensity Score:** Fires with higher intensities are prioritized. Again, exponential scaling is used, controlled by the `intensity_temperature` parameter.
3. **Weight Score:** Prioritization weights associated with fires are incorporated using exponential scaling controlled by `weight_temperature`.
4. **Combination:** All components are combined into a single score for each fire task. The fire level is used as a multiplier to emphasize its importance.
5. **Selection:** The task with the highest total score is chosen as the optimal target for the agent.

This approach balances the multiple factors of fire suppression: proximity, fire intensity, and task prioritization, enabling effective decision-making while adhering to the constraints and objectives of the multi-agent wildfire suppression task.

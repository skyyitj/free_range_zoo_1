Here is the implementation of the `single_agent_policy` function according to the described rules and considerations:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    import numpy as np
    
    # Temperature parameters for transforming distance, resource cost, and fire weight
    distance_temp = 1.0
    suppressant_temp = 1.0
    priority_temp = 1.0

    # Pre-compute distance from agent to each fire
    def euclidean_distance(p1, p2):
        return ((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2) ** 0.5

    distances = np.array([euclidean_distance(agent_pos, fire) for fire in fire_pos])

    # Compute the expected reduction in fire intensity at each fire location
    expected_reductions = agent_fire_reduction_power * agent_suppressant_num

    # Calculate the remaining fire intensity after assigning the agent
    remaining_intensities = np.maximum(0, np.array(fire_intensities) - expected_reductions)
    
    # Calculate distance-based scores (inverse relationship: closer fires are prioritized)
    distance_scores = np.exp(-distances / distance_temp)

    # Compute suppressant cost normalization (inverse relationship: more suppressant cost reduces priority)
    suppressant_scores = np.exp(-remaining_intensities / suppressant_temp)

    # Normalize priority weights
    priority_scores = np.exp(np.array(fire_putout_weight) / priority_temp)

    # Combine scores for a final score for each fire location
    total_scores = distance_scores * suppressant_scores * priority_scores

    # Select the index of the fire task with the highest score
    selected_task = int(np.argmax(total_scores))

    return selected_task
``` 

### Explanation:

1. **Distance-Based Prioritization**:
   - Fires closer to the agent lessen travel time and are prioritized using the inverse of the Euclidean distance. The score is scaled with the `distance_temp` parameter to adjust the sensitivity to distance.

2. **Suppressant Usage and Fire Intensity**:
   - Fires that require less suppressant or have lower remaining intensity (i.e., can be handled with currently available resources) are prioritized. Scores are computed based on the expected remaining fire intensity and scaled with the `suppressant_temp` parameter.

3. **Priority Weights**:
   - Priority weights (`fire_putout_weight`) directly affect the task selection. High-priority fires receive greater weight in the scoring system. Scores are scaled with the `priority_temp`.

4. **Weighted Scoring**:
   - The final score for each fire task combines distance, suppressant cost, and priority weight to balance multiple factors in decision-making.

5. **Task Assignment**:
   - The fire task with the highest score is selected for assignment.

This policy balances the agent's position, available resources, and task priorities to make effective decisions in minimizing fire spread and intensity. The use of temperature parameters allows fine-tuning of the policy for different scenarios.

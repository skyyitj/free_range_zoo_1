### Policy Logic
1. **Distance Factor:** Fires closer to the agent are relatively prioritized; the farther the fire, the smaller its contribution to the score.
2. **Fire Intensity Factor:** High-intensity fires (more severe fires) are given higher priority. Normalization ensures the intensity is scaled reasonably.
3. **Weight Factor:** Prioritizes fires with high reward weights, guiding agent behavior toward critical tasks.
4. **Resource Factor:** Ensures tasks that match the agent's available resources are prioritized. As the agent's suppressant nears depletion, tasks requiring less suppressant become preferable.
5. **Scoring System:** Combines all these factors into a multiplicative score, which enables seamless balancing between components.

### Temperature Normalization
The normalization is controlled by `distance_temp`, `intensity_temp`, and `weight_temp`. These allow fine-tuning the sensitivity of the respective factors. For example, increasing `distance_temp` reduces the importance of distance in score computation.

This policy ensures a balance between suppressing critical fires and conserving resources in a multi-agent wildfire suppression system.

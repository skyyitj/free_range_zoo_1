Here's the implementation of the `single_agent_policy` function that balances the considerations of fire suppression, resource conservation, and prioritization:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              # Current position of the agent (y, x)
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                      # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    import numpy as np

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    if num_tasks == 0:
        return -1  # No tasks available, return invalid task index

    scores = []

    # Temperature parameters for score component scaling
    distance_temp = 2.0
    intensity_temp = 5.0
    priority_temp = 3.0

    # Iterate through each fire task to compute a score
    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Compute distance from agent to fire location
        dist = np.sqrt((agent_pos[0] - fire_pos[i][0]) ** 2 + (agent_pos[1] - fire_pos[i][1]) ** 2)

        # Normalized distance score (smaller distance is better)
        distance_score = np.exp(-dist / distance_temp)

            remaining_fire = fire_intensities[i] - effective_reduction
        else:
            remaining_fire = fire_intensities[i]  # No suppressant left, fire remains unchanged

        # Discourage assigning tasks where fire cannot be extinguished soon
        potential_extinguish_score = 1.0 if remaining_fire <= 0 else 1.0 / (1 + remaining_fire)

        # Combine scores (weight them for final decision)
        score = (

### Explanation of Key Components
1. **Distance Score**:
   - The `distance_score` prioritizes fire tasks closer to the agent to reduce travel time.
   - An exponential decay function (`np.exp(-dist / distance_temp)`) is used to normalize the distance effect.

2. **Intensity Score**:
   - Higher fire intensity requires more attention, so it is prioritized using an exponential scaling based on the current fire intensity.
   - The temperature parameter (`intensity_temp`) controls the impact scaling of fire intensity.

3. **Priority Score**:
   - Each fire task has an external priority (reward weights) that guides task selection.
   - This is scaled using another exponential transformation based on `fire_putout_weight`.

4. **Potential Extinguish Score**:
   - This accounts for the agentâ€™s resources and evaluates whether the fire intensity can be meaningfully reduced by the agent.
   - If the fire can be extinguished (`remaining_fire <= 0`), this score is high; otherwise, it decreases as the remaining fire grows.

5. **Score Combination**:
   - Weighted linear combination of all scores to calculate a final score for each fire task.
   - The weights (e.g., `1.5`, `2.0`, `2.5`) balance the impact of different factors in the score.

6. **Task Selection**:
   - The task with the highest combined score is selected using `np.argmax(scores)`.

This policy ensures that agents prioritize critical fires, conserve resources, and consider distance and task prioritization weights effectively.

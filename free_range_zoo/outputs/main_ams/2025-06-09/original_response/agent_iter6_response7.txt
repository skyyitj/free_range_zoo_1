### Analysis and Adjustments:

1. **Distance Temp**: Was reduced to make the algorithm more sensitive to distances, implying tasks closer to the agent's current position are prioritized, potentially reducing travel time and quicker response to nearby fires.
  
2. **Effectiveness Temp**: Was increased to further emphasize the anticipated fire reduction each agent can contribute, optimizing fire control and aligning closer with reward attainment with greater efficiency.

3. **Importance Temp**: Increased to allow reward weights to have a greater influence on the decision, steering agents towards higher value tasks which directly translates to the optimization of average rewards gained.

4. **Suppressant Efficiency Temp**: This was adjusted upwards to ensure that suppressant usage efficiency becomes a more significant factor in task selection, optimizing the resource expenditure against the gains (fire intensity reduction).

These temperature adjustments should better balance task assignment considerations, potentially improving all evaluated metrics by focusing on resource efficiency, rewards maximization, and strategic fire suppression.

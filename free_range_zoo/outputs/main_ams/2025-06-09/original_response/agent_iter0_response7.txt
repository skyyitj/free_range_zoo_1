Explanation:
- The code calculates scores for each fire (task) based on various properties like the fire intensity, fire level, and the distance between the agent and the fire.
- The score components are adjusted by normalization and exponentiation with `temperature` parameters that can be tuned. This gives more control over the influence of each component in the decision making process.
- The final score for each task is a product of these adjusted components suggesting a multiplicative model where all factors need to be considered.
- The method selects the fire by choosing the task with the highest score, aiming to balance effective fire suppression and efficient use of resources.

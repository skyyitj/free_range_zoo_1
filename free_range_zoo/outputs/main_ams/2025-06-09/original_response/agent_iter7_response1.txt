Previous policy results indicated the need:

1. Enhance the importance of the remaining suppressant to encourage conservative suppressant use, thereby adhering to the "Used Suppressant" metric.
2. Calibrate the weight of effectiveness further because it wasn't reducing the fire intensity well enough, damaging the "Fire Intensity Change" metric.
3. Enhance the distance penalty sensitivity, as it's implied that agents are perhaps focusing too much on far-off fires.
4. Reducing the emphasis on task importance slightly allows the model to consider other crucial factors equally, possibly affecting the "Putout Number" negatively due to strong bias towards specific fires deemed previously important by weights.

These changes should guide the agents to a more balanced usage of resources, better prioritization of tasks, and thus optimized operation within the environment.

Let's analyze the current performance results and revise the policy to improve the metrics step by step:

### Feedback Analysis
#### 1. **Average Rewards (6.3000)**
   - This value is moderately good, but we aim to improve it by prioritizing tasks that have higher reward weights (`fire_putout_weight`) while ensuring that critical fires are addressed.

#### 2. **Average Fire Intensity Change (-0.93)**
   - A negative value shows that fire suppression is not effective. We need to enhance the scoring for fire intensity to ensure that highly severe fires are prioritized.

#### 3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency (1.0929 intensity/suppressant)**
   - This is acceptable, but it indicates that resource usage could be more efficient. We need to avoid over-suppressing fires or assigning agents where suppressant usage is redundant.

#### 4. **Burning/Burned-out Numbers**
   - These metrics indirectly indicate resource allocation issues or misprioritization. Fires remain unhandled or burn out because critical tasks are not being prioritized correctly.

#### 5. **Steps**
   - A reduction in steps is desirable, but only after ensuring tasks are effectively completed.

### Action Plan
1. Improve scoring for **fire intensity suppression** by adding a weighting factor for fires with higher intensities to reduce the `Fire Intensity Change` metric.
2. Introduce a cap on **suppressant usage** to prevent excessive resource usage and increase **Suppressant Efficiency**.
3. Add a **prioritization metric** for fires that are at high risk of self-extinguishing (high `fire_levels`), aiming to reduce `Burnedout Number`.
4. Enhance penalties for unhandled fires to reduce `Burning Number`.

Here's the updated policy function:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                      
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    import math

    # Define temperature parameters for components
    distance_temperature = 8  # Prioritize proximity
    intensity_temperature = 5  # Strengthen the effect of fire intensity
    suppressant_temperature = 2  # Reward efficient suppressant usage
    burnout_risk_temperature = 4  # Penalize fires close to burning out

    scores = []
    for i in range(len(fire_pos)):
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[i]
        agent_y, agent_x = agent_pos
        
        # Compute distance between agent and fire
        distance = math.sqrt((fire_y - agent_y)**2 + (fire_x - agent_x)**2)
        distance_score = math.exp(-distance / distance_temperature)

        # Normalize fire intensity as a task priority component
        intensity_score = math.exp(fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temperature)

        # Compute suppressant score
        required_suppressant = fire_intensities[i] / agent_fire_reduction_power
        suppressant_score = (
            math.exp(-required_suppressant / suppressant_temperature)
            if agent_suppressant_num >= required_suppressant
            else 0
        )

        # Add a penalty for fires that are dangerously close to burning out
        burnout_risk = math.exp(fire_levels[i] / burnout_risk_temperature)

        # Final task score combines all components
        total_score = (
            fire_putout_weight[i] * intensity_score * suppressant_score * distance_score / burnout_risk
        )
        scores.append(total_score)

    # Choose the task with the highest score
    return int(scores.index(max(scores)))
```

---

### Changes in Policy
1. **Enhanced Fire Intensity Scoring:**
   - Fire intensity (`fire_intensities[i]`) is scaled using a lower temperature, putting greater importance on severe fires.

2. **Suppressant Efficiency:**
   - Adjusted scaling for suppressant usage to reward agents that effectively suppress fires without overusing resources.

3. **Burnout Risk Penalty:**
   - Added a penalty for fires with high levels (`fire_levels[i]`), encouraging agents to handle critical fires before they burn out.

4. **Distance Scaling:**
   - Left distance scaling intact but ensured it doesn't overpower fire intensity scoring.

---

### Expected Improvements
- **Average Rewards:** Should increase as agents are better aligned with reward priorities (`fire_putout_weight`).
- **Fire Intensity Change:** Should become positive as critical fires are suppressed more effectively.
- **Suppressant Efficiency:** Should increase due to better resource management.
- **Burning/Burned-out Numbers:** Should decrease as agents prioritize fires at risk of burning out or spreading.

This revamped policy function aims to deliver measurable improvements across all key performance metrics.

Here's the implementation of the `single_agent_policy` function based on the given rules and considerations:

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                      
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    import numpy as np
    
    # Setting temperature parameters for normalization
    distance_temperature = 5.0
    intensity_temperature = 2.0
    reward_temperature = 3.0

    def calculate_distance(agent_pos, fire_pos):
        return np.sqrt((fire_pos[0] - agent_pos[0])**2 + (fire_pos[1] - agent_pos[1])**2)

    num_tasks = len(fire_pos)
    task_scores = []

    for i in range(num_tasks):
        # Calculate distance to fire location
        distance = calculate_distance(agent_pos, fire_pos[i])

        # Distance component: inverse weighting
        distance_score = np.exp(-distance / distance_temperature)

        # Fire intensity component: higher intensity gets higher priority
        intensity_score = np.exp(fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temperature)

        # Fire reward weight component (prioritization based on external weights)
        reward_score = np.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / reward_temperature)

        # Check available suppressant for this task
        resource_penalty = 0 if agent_suppressant_num > fire_intensities[i] else -1

        # Combine scores (weighted sum)
        combined_score = (distance_score * 0.4) + (intensity_score * 0.4) + (reward_score * 0.2) + resource_penalty
        task_scores.append(combined_score)

    # Select the task with the highest score
    best_task_index = int(np.argmax(task_scores))
    return best_task_index
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Distance Component:** 
   - Proximity to the fire location is rewarded. We compute the Euclidean distance between the agent and each fire. This is normalized with a temperature variable to avoid drastic impacts due to small distance differences.

2. **Fire Intensity Component:** 
   - Fires with higher intensity get more priority because they are harder to suppress and more likely to spread.

3. **Reward Weight Component:** 
   - External priority weights guide the decision, emphasizing specific fire locations that are critical to address.

4. **Resource Management Component:** 
   - A penalty is applied if the agent does not have sufficient suppressant to handle the intensity of a fire task. This discourages assigning tasks that exhaust resources wastefully.

5. **Normalization with Temperature Variables:** 
   - Each component's score is normalized using exponential transformations and predefined temperature parameters for consistent scaling.

6. **Score Combination:** 
   - Task scores are calculated as a weighted sum of the individual components, allowing balanced prioritization.

7. **Task Selection:** 
   - The task with the highest combined score is selected for fire suppression. If multiple tasks have the same score, the first highest is chosen (default behavior of `np.argmax`).

This policy ensures the agent makes decisions based on proximity, fire intensity, external priorities, and available resources while suppressing fires optimally and efficiently.

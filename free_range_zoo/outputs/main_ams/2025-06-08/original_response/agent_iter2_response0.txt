  Based for fires that can be fully extinguished by on the analysis, the revised function will we'll:
1. **Refine Prioritization Scheme:**
   - Improvement: Adjust the policy to act on highly critical fires earlier - Incorporate the agent's remaining resources.

   - Reducing steps can on critical factors like proximity, fire severity, number of fires that burn out fires.
2. Introduce a fire-severity multiplier help complete the task more efficiently.

   - Introduce a new score component that gives weight to both intensity and levels - Improvement: Prioritize nearby tasks and fires that can to discourage actions that leave fires un.

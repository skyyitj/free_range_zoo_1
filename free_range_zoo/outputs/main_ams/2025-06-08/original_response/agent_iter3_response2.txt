Let's analyze the policy feedback step by step and systematically improve the function:

---

### Analysis of Metrics and Feedback

1. **Average Rewards (6.2000)**:
    - This value is moderate but needs improvement. It indicates the agents are performing decently but still leaving room for optimization.
    - Higher rewards typically come from better prioritization of high-reward fires.

2. **Average Fire Intensity Change (-0.88)**:
    - A negative value means fire intensity is growing on average. This directly indicates the policy is failing to prioritize critical fires effectively.
    - We need to focus on suppressing fires with high intensity and fires at risk of spreading.

3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency (1.0520)**:
    - This value is acceptable, but higher suppressant efficiency leads to better resource management and suppression. It indicates we need to focus on balancing suppressant use versus fire-intensity reduction.

4. **Burning Number/Burnedout Number**:
    - Unhandled fires (burning number) and fires burning out (burnedout number) need to be reduced. This happens when agents fail to allocate resources effectively to fires that are growing rapidly or are close to burning out.

5. **Putout Number**:
    - Fires extinguished successfully need to increase, which means better prioritization of fires that can be fully extinguished.

6. **Steps**:
    - Reducing steps involves focusing on high-impact tasks to quickly contain fires and prevent spread.

### Policy Adjustments

To improve the metrics, we will:
1. **Prioritize high-reward fires** by refining the reward-weight component with a more aggressive transformation.
2. **Enhance fire intensity suppression** by adding a scaling factor to the intensity score to emphasize high-intensity fires.
3. **Penalize fires burning out** more strongly to ensure agents allocate resources to fires at risk of burning out.
4. **Improve suppressant efficiency** by incorporating a more dynamic calculation for suppressant use.
5. **Balance distance considerations** to prevent agents from neglecting distant fires while still prioritizing nearby ones.
6. **Introduce a "critical suppression potential" metric**, which evaluates which fires can be quickly extinguished and optimizes task allocation accordingly.

### Key Changes

1. **Reward Prioritization**:
    - Strengthened `reward_score` transformation to better prioritize high-reward fires while still balancing other factors.

2. **Fire Intensity Scoring**:
    - Increased emphasis on high-intensity fires by scaling their scores more aggressively with `intensity_temperature`.

3. **Burnout Penalty**:
    - Increased penalty for fires close to burning out to ensure agents quickly allocate resources to these fires.

4. **Suppressant Efficiency**:
    - Refined scoring for suppressant efficiency with `suppressant_temperature` to reduce resource wastage.

5. **Suppression Potential**:
    - Added `suppression_potential`, a new component to prioritize fires that can be fully extinguished quickly.

6. **Distance Scaling**:
    - Softened focus on proximity slightly to ensure agents can target distant fires when important.

### Expected Improvements

1. **Rewards**:
    - Higher average rewards due to better prioritization of high-reward fires.

2. **Fire Intensity Change**:
    - Positive or minimal negative value as agents focus on high-intensity fires and improve suppression efficiency.

3. **Suppressant Efficiency**:
    - Better efficiency due to improved allocation and prioritization of achievable fire suppression tasks.

4. **Burning/Burnedout Numbers**:
    - Reduced unhandled and burned-out fires as agents allocate resources more effectively.

5. **Putout Number**:
    - Increased successfully extinguished fires by focusing on achievable suppression targets.

6. **Steps**:
    - Reduced task completion steps due to improved prioritization and suppression efficiency.

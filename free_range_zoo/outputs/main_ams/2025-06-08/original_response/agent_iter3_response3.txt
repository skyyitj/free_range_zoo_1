Let's analyze the policy feedback step by step based on the results provided.

### Feedback Analysis

1. **Average Rewards (6.2000):**
   - This value is moderately high, indicating progress in task completion. However, further improvements can focus on prioritizing high-reward fires effectively to push this value higher.

2. **Average Fire Intensity Change (-0.88):**
   - A negative value implies fires are spreading or intensifying on average. This is a significant issue that demonstrates the policy's inability to contain and suppress fires effectively. Prioritization of high-intensity fires and improving suppressant allocation should help address this.

3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency (1.0520):**
   - While moderately acceptable, this value shows room for improvement by better allocating suppressant resources to maximize the reduction in fire intensity.

4. **Other Metrics:**
   - **Burning Number:** Fires left unhandled should be reduced by improving task prioritization.
   - **Putout Number:** Increasing extinguishment by handling fires close to cooldown.
   - **Burnedout Number:** Lower this by targeting fires at risk of burning out.
   - **Steps:** Focus on faster suppression by prioritizing crucial fires.

### Key Improvements

1. **Improve Fire Suppression:** Assign higher priority to fires with high intensity to minimize their spread and lower average fire intensity change.
2. **Optimize Resource Management:** Allocate suppressant more efficiently to fires that yield maximum suppression per resource unit.
3. **Reward Scaling:** Adjust focus on maximizing reward accumulation strategically.
4. **Fix High Burnedout Numbers:** Penalize fires nearing burnout to prevent negative impacts.

### Revised Policy Function

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                      
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    import math

    # Temperature parameters for policy tuning
    reward_temperature = 3.5  # Emphasize high-reward fires
    intensity_temperature = 4  # Prioritize high-intensity fires
    suppressant_temperature = 2.5  # Balance suppressant efficiency
    burnout_temperature = 3.5  # Penalize fires at risk of burning out
    distance_temperature = 9  # Slight focus on proximity

    scores = []
    for i in range(len(fire_pos)):
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[i]
        agent_y, agent_x = agent_pos

        # --- Reward Component ---
        reward_score = math.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / reward_temperature)

        # --- Fire Intensity Component ---

        suppressant_score = (
            math.exp(-required_suppressant / suppressant_temperature)
            if agent_suppressant_num >= required_suppressant else 0
        )

        # --- Distance Component ---

        distance_score = math.exp(-distance / distance_temperature)

        # --- Combine Scores ---
        total_score = (
            reward_score *
            intensity_score *
            suppressant_score *
            distance_score /
            (burnout_penalty + 1e-6)  # Prevent division by zero
        )
        scores.append(total_score)

    # Choose the task with the highest score
    return int(scores.index(max(scores)))

### Key Updates

1. **Reward Component:**
   - Adjusted `reward_temperature` slightly to place higher emphasis on maximizing rewards.

2. **Fire Intensity Component:**
   - Improved prioritization of high-intensity fires by reducing `intensity_temperature` slightly to better manage spreading fires.

3. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Fine-tuned `suppressant_temperature` for better allocation efficiency.

4. **Burnout Penalty:**
   - Explicitly emphasized the penalty for fires nearing burnout by slightly lowering the `burnout_temperature`.

5. **Distance Component:**
   - Incorporated a slight focus on proximity with newly adjusted `distance_temperature` to handle reachable fires more effectively.

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Higher Rewards:** Focusing on high-reward fires should increase the average reward metric.
2. **Fire Intensity Change:** Better suppression of high-intensity fires should minimize spreading, making this value approach zero or become positive.
3. **Improved Suppressant Efficiency:** Efficient use of suppressant resources will yield a higher efficiency metric.
4. **Reduced Burning/Burnedout Numbers:** Improved prioritization should address unhandled fires and fires nearing burnout.
5. **Increased Putout Number:** Focusing on fires close to suppression should increase extinguished fires.
6. **Reduced Steps:** Efficient handling of fires should reduce the number of steps needed.

This revised policy should yield better results across all metrics while maintaining a balanced approach to multiple objectives.

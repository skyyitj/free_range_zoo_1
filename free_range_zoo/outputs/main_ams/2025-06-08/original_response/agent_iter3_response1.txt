Let's carefully analyze the metrics step by step to identify the weaknesses and propose improvements:

---

### Metrics Analysis

1. **Average Rewards (6.2000):**
   - While acceptable, the goal is to maximize rewards. This can be achieved by better prioritizing tasks with higher reward weights and ensuring agents extinguish fires that provide maximum benefit.

2. **Average Fire Intensity Change (-0.88):**
   - This negative value indicates that fires are growing in intensity over time, which is a key issue. Agents need to suppress fires faster and more efficiently. We need to boost prioritization of high-intensity fires.

3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency (1.0520):**
   - This metric is moderately good but can be improved further. Agents should allocate suppressant resources more judiciously, focusing on fires that can be extinguished with minimal resource expenditure.

4. **Burning Number:**
   - Reduce the number of unhandled fires by ensuring optimal task distribution among agents.

5. **Putout Number:**
   - This metric can be improved by clearing fires that are close to extinguishment first and by focusing suppression efforts effectively.

6. **Burnedout Number:**
   - Fires burning out without agent intervention result in penalties. Agents must prioritize fires at risk of burning outâ€”those with exceedingly high levels.

7. **Steps:**
   - Reduce the number of steps by emphasizing efficiency in fire suppression. Target fires whose suppression is quicker and impactful.

### Observations and Proposed Improvements

1. **Reward Weight Integration:**
   - Prioritize fires that contribute the highest rewards while balancing the fire containment goal.

2. **Fire Intensity Prioritization:**
   - Fires with high intensity should be prioritized to prevent their spread and growth.

3. **Suppressant Optimization:**
   - Improve efficiency of suppressant usage by considering fires where resources will have maximum impact.

4. **Burnout Penalty:**
   - Fires at risk of burning out must be penalized highly to reduce penalties.

5. **Proximity Score Refinement:**
   - Nearby fires should still be factored in, but their significance should be moderated relative to reward and intensity.

### Revised Policy Function

```python
def single_agent_policy(
    # === Agent Properties ===
    agent_pos: Tuple[float, float],              
    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                

    # === Team Information ===
    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], 

    # === Fire Task Information ===
    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         
    fire_levels: List[int],                      
    fire_intensities: List[float],               

    # === Task Prioritization ===
    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             
) -> int:
    """
    Choose the optimal fire-fighting task for a single agent.
    """
    import math

    # Temperature parameters for policy tuning
    distance_temperature = 7  # Moderate focus on proximity
    intensity_temperature = 6  # Strong focus on high-intensity fires
    suppressant_temperature = 4  # Balance suppressant allocation
    burnout_penalty_temperature = 5  # Prevent penalties from fires burning out
    reward_temperature = 4  # Emphasize the importance of rewards

    scores = []
    for i in range(len(fire_pos)):
        fire_y, fire_x = fire_pos[i]
        agent_y, agent_x = agent_pos

        # --- Calculate distance score ---
        distance = math.sqrt((fire_y - agent_y)**2 + (fire_x - agent_x)**2)
        distance_score = math.exp(-distance / distance_temperature)

        # --- Calculate fire intensity score ---
        intensity_score = math.exp(fire_intensities[i] / intensity_temperature)

        # --- Calculate suppressant efficiency score ---
        required_suppressant = fire_intensities[i] / agent_fire_reduction_power
        suppressant_score = (
            math.exp(-required_suppressant / suppressant_temperature)
            if agent_suppressant_num >= required_suppressant else 0
        )

        # --- Calculate burnout penalty score ---
        burnout_penalty = math.exp(fire_levels[i] / burnout_penalty_temperature)

        # --- Calculate reward weight score ---
        reward_score = math.exp(fire_putout_weight[i] / reward_temperature)

        # --- Combine scores ---
        total_score = (
            reward_score *
            intensity_score *
            suppressant_score /
            (burnout_penalty + distance_score + 1e-6)  # Prevent overly favoring distant fires
        )
        scores.append(total_score)

    # Choose the task with the highest score
    return int(scores.index(max(scores)))
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Reward Weight Scaling:**
   - `reward_score` is now emphasized further using `reward_temperature` to prioritize fires that maximize accumulated rewards.

2. **Intensity Scoring:**
   - Increased the weight of `intensity_score` using `intensity_temperature` to focus on high-intensity fires for effective suppression.

3. **Burnout Penalty:**
   - Fires with extremely high levels are penalized heavily via `burnout_penalty_temperature`.

4. **Suppressant Efficiency:**
   - Adjusted the suppressant allocation for better resource management.

5. **Proximity Moderation:**
   - Ensured `distance_score` contributes to agent task selection without overly favoring nearby fires over critical ones.

---

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Rewards:** Higher average rewards due to improved prioritization of high-reward fires. 
2. **Fire Intensity Change:** Positive or less negative change indicating better fire mitigation.
3. **Suppressant Efficiency:** Enhanced efficiency as suppressant is utilized effectively.
4. **Burnedout Number:** Reduced penalties from burned-out fires by focusing on critical fires.
5. **Steps:** Lower steps due to prioritization of impactful fires and more efficient suppression.

This newly revised policy function aims to balance the task goals while addressing the weaknesses identified in the feedback. Metrics are expected to improve iteratively with this approach.

Here is the implementation of the wildfire suppression task policy function:

```python

    agent_fire_reduction_power: float,           # How much fire the agent can reduce
    agent_suppressant_num: float,                # Amount of fire suppressant available

    other_agents_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]], # Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]

    fire_pos: List[Tuple[float, float]],         # Locations of all fires [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...]
    fire_levels: List[int],                    # Current intensity level of each fire
    fire_intensities: List[float],               # Current intensity value of each fire task

    fire_putout_weight: List[float],             # Priority weights for fire suppression tasks
) -> int:

### Explanation of Policy Function Behavior:
1. **Distance Component**:
    - Fires closer to the agent are prioritized.
    - The distance component is normalized using an exponential decay, controlled by the `distance_temperature`.

2. **Fire Intensity Component**:
    - Fires with higher intensity are prioritized.
    - The fire intensity component is normalized using an exponential transformation, with the `fire_intensity_temperature` controlling sensitivity.

3. **Suppressant Resource Component**:
    - Fires that can effectively be suppressed with current resources are given preference.
    - The suppressive ability is modeled using a normalized score that checks whether the agent's resources are sufficient.

4. **Task Weight Component**:
    - The `fire_weight`, provided as input, heavily influences the priority of specific fire tasks. Fires with higher weights are treated as more critical.

5. **Combination**:
    - The final score for each task combines all the components multiplicatively. This ensures that all factors are balanced in decision-making.

The policy selects the fire task with the maximum combined score, balancing critical factors to optimize firefighting efforts.

Let's analyze the feedback step by step:

1. **Rewards:** Average rewards are positive (4.4906), indicating that the agents are earning rewards successfully. However, we should aim to increase this value by optimizing task prioritization and suppressant use.

2. **Fire Intensity Change:** The average change is -1.00. This indicates that fire severity is decreasing, but could be improved further. We need to focus on efficient fire suppression.

3. **Suppressant Efficiency:** The current efficiency is 1.2037 intensity/suppressant. This is reasonable but can be improved further by optimizing suppressant allocation.

4. **Burning Number:** This metric should be minimized, as it reflects the average number of fires remaining unhandled in each step. Addressing this requires better task prioritization.

5. **Putout Number:** This metric should be maximized by extinguishing fires successfully. Improving task prioritization and focusing on high-impact fires would help.

6. **Burnedout Number:** A lower value is better, but we must ensure that fires do not burn out naturally by acting promptly.

7. **Steps:** A lower value is ideal, as it indicates quicker resolution of the task. Efficient decision-making can help reduce the time taken.

### Improvement Plan:
- Optimize the temperature values associated with distance, fire intensity, and priority weights to ensure better balance.
- Enhance focus on unhandled fires to reduce the burning number.
- Target high-impact fires to maximize rewards and putout numbers.
- Use suppressant resources more strategically to improve efficacy and efficiency.

### Changes in the Revised Policy:
1. **Temperatures:** Adjusted temperature values to emphasize fire severity and task prioritization.
2. **Distance Impact:** Increased penalty for distant fires to improve resource efficiency locally.
3. **Score Combination:** Better task score weighting to prioritize critical fires and improve suppressant efficiency.

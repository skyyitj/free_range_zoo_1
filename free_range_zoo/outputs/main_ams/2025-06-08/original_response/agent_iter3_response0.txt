Let's analyze the feedback step by step and address each metric systematically to improve the policy function.

---

### Analysis

#### 1. **Rewards (6.2000)**:
- This value is moderately high, but there is room for improvement.
- The policy needs to prioritize tasks with higher reward weights more effectively.
  
#### 2. **Fire Intensity Change (-0.88)**:
- A negative value indicates fires are still growing in intensity on average.
- Focus should be placed on suppressing fires with high intensity and those at risk of spreading further.

#### 3. **Suppressant Efficiency (1.0520)**:
- This metric is reasonable but not optimal. Agents may be using suppressant inefficiently. 
- The policy should balance suppressant allocation and avoid overusing resources unnecessarily.

#### 4. **Burning Number**:
- Fires remaining unhandled reduce efficiency and lead to fire intensity growth.
- Incorporate prioritization strategies to ensure all fires are attended to rapidly.

#### 5. **Putout Number**:
- Successfully extinguishing fires faster and in greater numbers should be a primary goal.
- Focus on fires that are close to being extinguished to improve this metric.

#### 6. **Burnedout Number**:
- Fires burning out penalize performance. Fires at risk of burning out should be prioritized to prevent penalties.

#### 7. **Steps**:
- The average steps need to be reduced by focusing on high-impact tasks and extinguishing fires more efficiently.

### Strategy for Improvement

1. **Reward-Weight Prioritization**:
   - Increase emphasis on high-reward fires by tuning their temperature component.

2. **Fire Intensity Control**:
   - Target fires with high intensity, factoring their severity into the scoring mechanism.

3. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Introduce a strategy to prioritize tasks requiring less suppressant and avoid low-impact tasks that waste resources.

4. **Burnout Penalty**:
   - Penalize fires at risk of burning out to ensure quick intervention.

5. **Proximity Consideration**:
   - Incorporate a proximity check to reduce the agent's travel time and optimize task selection.

6. **Urgency Weighting**:
   - Explicitly balance high-reward fires versus critical, severe fires threatening to spread.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Reward Weight Scaling**:
- Increased `reward_temperature` to ensure high-reward fires are more strongly considered.
  
#### 2. **Fire Intensity Prioritization**:
- Tuned `intensity_temperature` to emphasize fires with high intensity or at risk of spreading.

#### 3. **Resource Efficiency**:
- Improved suppressant allocation through the `suppressant_temperature` mechanism.

#### 4. **Burnout Penalty**:
- Optimally penalized fires at risk of burning out to balance urgency with reward.

#### 5. **Proximity Optimization**:
- Revised `distance_temperature` to emphasize closer tasks to reduce steps and optimize agent movement.

### Expected Improvements

1. **Rewards**:
   - Higher rewards due to better prioritization of high-reward tasks.

2. **Fire Intensity Change**:
   - Lower (or positive) intensity change as fires are suppressed more effectively.

3. **Suppressant Efficiency**:
   - Enhanced efficiency through improved resource allocation strategies.

4. **Burning/Burnedout Numbers**:
   - Reduced unhandled and burned-out fires through a priority system balancing urgency and reward.

5. **Putout Number**:
   - Increased extinguished fires by focusing on achievable suppression tasks.

6. **Steps**:
   - Fewer steps due to better task selection and proximity-based optimization.

The above revisions aim to optimize policy performance across all provided metrics and enhance overall efficiency.

Let's carefully analyze the policy feedback step by step to understand where improvements are needed:

### Analysis
1. **Average Rewards (6.3000):**
   - This value is moderately high but can still be improved. 
   - To enhance rewards, the policy should focus more on prioritizing high-reward fires.

2. **Average Fire Intensity Change (-0.93):**
   - A negative value means fires are growing in intensity on average. 
   - This is a major issue that suggests the policy is not effectively suppressing high-intensity fires quickly enough. 
   - The policy needs to improve prioritization of fires with high intensity and those at risk of growing further.

3. **Average Suppressant Efficiency (1.0929):**
   - This value is reasonable but can be improved by making better use of suppressant resources. 
   - The policy must calculate suppressant allocation more effectively and avoid wasting suppressant on low-impact tasks.

4. **Other Metrics:**
   - **Burning Number:** Unhandled fires should be minimized by ensuring each agent selects tasks efficiently.
   - **Putout Number:** The number of extinguished fires needs to increase by focusing on fires that are close to being fully suppressed.
   - **Burnedout Number:** Fires burning out are negative. High-intensity fires at risk of burning out should be given higher priority to prevent penalties.
   - **Steps:** Reduce the number of steps by focusing on higher-impact tasks for faster extinguishing.

### Key Improvements:
1. Add a component to focus on **high-reward fires** without compromising on critical fires.
2. Improve the evaluation of **fire intensity** by balancing its temperature and assigning higher importance to severely growing fires (fires with very high levels).
3. Introduce a **remaining suppressant prioritization** component, where fires requiring less suppressant are prioritized.
4. Incorporate a **proximity check** for better task allocation efficiency.
5. Penalize fires at **risk of burning out** to ensure they are handled earlier.

### Revised Policy Function

### Key Changes:
1. **Reward Weight Scaling:**
   - Added `reward_temperature` to give more weight to high-reward fires without overly prioritizing them.

2. **Intensity Scoring Refinement:**
   - Adjusted `intensity_temperature` to emphasize high-intensity fires that need urgent action.

3. **Burnout Penalty:**
   - Incorporated a penalty for fires with high levels to reduce penalties from fires burning out.

4. **Suppressant Efficiency:**
   - Improved scoring for fires requiring less suppressant, ensuring resource-efficient allocation.

5. **Distance Scaling:**
   - Refined `distance_temperature` to maintain balance between nearby and distant critical fires.

---

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Rewards:** Higher rewards due to better prioritization of high-reward fires.
2. **Fire Intensity Change:** A positive or smaller negative value as fires are suppressed more effectively.
3. **Suppressant Efficiency:** Improved efficiency by better allocating suppressant to critical fires.
4. **Burning/Burnedout Numbers:** Reduced unhandled and burned-out fires due to better prioritization.
5. **Putout Number:** Increased extinguished fires by focusing on achievable fire suppression.

This revised policy function is designed to address the shortcomings highlighted in the feedback while maintaining a balance between multiple objectives.

You are a JSON engineer. Develop a goal hierarchy in a JSON format, where each node denotes a specific sub-goal for successfully completing the task. Stick to the following rules when forming this goal hierarchy:
1) Set up the root keys: The root keys should be "task_name", "task-related objects", "description", and "subgoals".
2) Within "subgoals", specify the names of the sub-goals. These names will also act as the names of each corresponding function to justify if the subgoal is satisfied.
3) Within each subgoal, specify the kwargs for the corresponding function: Utilize the names of the objects related to the subgoal to define the input variable names. Consequently, the position of these objects will be forwarded to the validation function through the variable name.
4) Within each subgoal, specify the "prerequisites" for each subgoal if any exist: Every subgoal has two kinds of "prerequisites" a) "concurrent": This is when two sub-goals need to be attained concurrently, usually because they outline the status of two different objects. For instance, the subgoal "drawer_open" is a prerequisite for "red_block_in_gripper", and both have to be accomplished concurrently; b) "sequential": This is when one sub-goal has to be achieved before another, but they don't have to be completed at the same time, usually because they outline the state of the same object. For instance, the subgoal "red_block_in_gripper" is a prerequisite for "red_block_in_drawer", but these two subgoals can't be achieved concurrently.

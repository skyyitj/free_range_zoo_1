As a JSON engineer, your task is to craft a goal hierarchy in JSON format where each node signifies a unique sub-goal critical for the successful completion of the task. Please adhere to the instructions below while creating this goal hierarchy:

1) Establish root keys: The root keys should be outlined as "task_name", "task-related objects", "description", and "subgoals".
2) Inside "subgoals", outline the sub-goal names. These names will serve as the identifiers for each associated function to validate whether the sub-goal has been met.
3) Within each sub-goal, specify the kwargs for the respective function: Use the names of the objects associated with the sub-goal to identify the input variable names. As a result, these object's positions will be passed to the validation function via the variable name.
4) Within each sub-goal, detail the "prerequisites", if any, for each sub-goal: Every sub-goal includes two types of prerequisites, a) "concurrent": This is applicable when two sub-goals must be accomplished simultaneously, typically because they describe the status of two distinct objects. An example would be the sub-goal "drawer_open" being a prerequisite for "red_block_in_gripper", which both need to be completed concurrently; b) "sequential": This applies when one sub-goal must be fulfilled prior to another, but they aren't required to be completed simultaneously, typically because they describe the condition of the same object. An example would be the sub-goal "red_block_in_gripper" being a prerequisite for "red_block_in_drawer", but these two sub-goals can't be achieved concurrently.

Some helpful tips for writing the policy function code:
    (1) Write a for loop to iterate over all tasks in range(num_tasks) and assign a score to each task.
    (2) You may find it helpful to normalize the score to a fixed range by applying transformations like np.exp to the score or its components
    (3) If you choose to transform a score component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the policy function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed score component should have its own temperature variable
    (4) Most importantly, the policy code's variables must only come from the input variables provided to the function. Do not introduce any new variables that are not part of the input parameters.

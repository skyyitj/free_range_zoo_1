Multi-Agent Wildfire Suppression Task

Objective:
Multiple agents collaborate to extinguish wildfires in a grid environment.

Task Rules:
1. Assignment Constraints:
   - Each agent can only be assigned to one fire location per decision step
   - Agents can be assigned to any fire location regardless of distance

2. Fire Dynamics:
   - Fire intensity decreases based on agent's suppressant use
   - Remaining fire = Current intensity - (Agent's suppressant Ã— Reduction power)
   - If fire intensity remains positive, it is possible to spread to neighboring grid cells
   - If fire level exceeds threshold, it self-extinguishes but penalizes agents

3. Resource Management:
   - Agents have limited suppressant resources
   - Suppressant is consumed when fighting fires
   - Strategic resource allocation is crucial

4. Reward Structure:
   - Each fire location has an associated reward weight (float)
   - Reward weights are provided as regular floating-point numbers
   - Example: fire_putout_weight = [4.0, 4.0] for two fire locations

Key Considerations:
- Balance between immediate fire control and resource conservation
- Prevent fire spread by prioritizing critical locations
- Avoid letting fires reach self-extinguishing levels
- Use reward weights to guide task prioritization

You are a policy engineer designing decision functions for firefighting agents in a wildfire simulation.

Task: Create policies for agents to extinguish wildfires collaboratively with these conditions:
- Fires emerge and spread based on realistic mechanics
- Agents have limited suppressant that must be recharged
- Agents must retreat when resources are depleted

Your goal: Maximize firefighting effectiveness while managing resource constraints.

Function template: {policy_signature}. You may only modify the function body, not the signature.

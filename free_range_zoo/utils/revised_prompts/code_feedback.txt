Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved policy function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) You can start with "let's think step by step", and then look at each metric individually and think about how can you improve it
    (2)If the agent's performance is poor, consider whether the positions of other agents relative to the fire are properly accounted for in the decision-making process
    (3) If the total reward maintains negative, then you must rewrite the entire policy function
    (4) If the values for a certain metric are not satisfying, then this means the written policy function is not able to accomplish the task goal. You may consider:
        (a) Changing the temperature scale so that this metric can be balanced
        (b) Re-writing the related policy
        (c) Discarding an unimportant temperature variable or add a new temperature variable
Now, output the revised policy function.

    Determines the best action for an agent in the wildfire environment.

    Args:
        agent_pos: Position of this agent (y, x)
        agent_fire_reduction_power: Fire suppression power of this agent
        agent_suppressant_num: Number of suppressant available
        other_agents_pos: Positions of all other agents [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...] shape: (num_agents-1, 2)
        fire_pos: Positions of all fire tasks [(y1, x1), (y2, x2), ...] shape: (num_tasks, 2)
        fire_levels: Current fire level of each task shape: (num_tasks,)
        fire_intensities: Intensity (difficulty) of each task shape: (num_tasks,)
        valid_action_space: List[List[int]]
            A 2D list representing the environment's grid, where each element indicates the validity of an action at that position.
            -1 indicates no fire (invalid action), while non-negative integers represent fires within the agent's observation range.
            Example:
            For a 3x3 grid with agent at (1,1) and 4 fires:
            - Fire 0 at (0,0)  # In observation range
            - Fire 1 at (1,2)  # In observation range
            - Fire 2 at (2,1)  # In observation range
            - Fire 3 at (2,2)  # Out of observation range
            valid_action_space would be:
            [
                [0, -1, -1],  # Row 0: Fire 0 at (0,0), others no fire
                [-1, -1, 1],  # Row 1: Fire 1 at (1,2), others no fire
                [-1, 2, -1]   # Row 2: Fire 2 at (2,1), Fire 3 at (2,2) out of range
            ]
            Where:
            - -1 means no fire or fire not in observation range (like Fire 3 at (2,2))
            - Non-negative numbers (0,1,2) represent fire indices within agent's observation range
            - The numbers correspond to indices in the fire_pos list

    Returns:
        int: Index of the chosen task to address (0 to num_tasks-1)

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback with the goal of optimizing the policy function's performance. Here are some actionable tips for analyzing the policy feedback:

(1) If the success rates are consistently near zero, prioritize rewriting the entire policy function to better align with the task objectives.
(2) If the reward for a certain policy component are nearly identical throughout, indicating that RL is not effectively optimizing it, consider:
    (a) Adjusting its scale or the value of its temperature parameter to enhance sensitivity.
    (b) Re-writing the policy component to better capture the desired behavior.
    (c) Discarding the policy component if it proves irrelevant or redundant.
(3) If some policy components' magnitudes are significantly larger, re-scale their values to ensure a balanced contribution across components.

Start by analyzing each existing policy component as suggested above, then proceed to write the policy function code. You can only include a single piece of python code in your reply, please add the changes directly to the code.

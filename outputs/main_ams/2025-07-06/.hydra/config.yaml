  description: Coordinate multiple firefighting agents to suppress wildfires in a
    grid environment. Agents must manage their resources (power and suppressant) while
    considering equipment status and environmental impact. The environment is dynamic
    and partially observable, with fires that can spread across adjacent tiles and
    vary in intensity. Fires can also burn out once they reach a certain intensity
    threshold.The goal is to minimize fire spread and intensity while optimizing resource
    usage and preventing equipment damage.

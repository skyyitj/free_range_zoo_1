 You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: def compute_reward() -> Tuple[np.array, Dict[str, np.array]]:
    ...
    return reward, {}

The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Ensure the reward values are constrained into a range to prevent overflow
    (5) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

In this reward function, the agent gets a reward for reducing the total number of fires and the fire intensity. The efficiency on using suppressants also affects the reward (the less unused suppressants, the higher the reward). A higher reward is given if all agents have their equipment in a good condition. The individual rewards are calculated using the exponential function, which helps to effectively evoke the agents' interests in achieving the best results for every sub-goal. The temperature parameters can be tuned to give different priorities to the different components of the reward.

    return final_reward, {'distance_reward': distance_reward, 'fire_reward': fire_reward}
```
In this reward function, we are encouraging the agent to go closer to the fire and decrease the amount of fire. We compute distance_reward inversely proportional to the total distance from the agent to the fire across the region, fire_reward inversely proportional to the number of fires in the environment. We process these rewards with exponential function in order to normalize them with temperature parameter, then blend them to get a 'final_reward'. Depending on the task's exact requirements, you might want to adjust the weighting between the distance and the fire components.

 You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: def compute_reward() -> Tuple[np.array, Dict[str, np.array]]:
    ...
    return reward, {}

The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Ensure the reward values are constrained into a range to prevent overflow
    (5) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

In this reward function, we are encouraging the agent to go closer to the fire and decrease the amount of fire. We compute distance_reward inversely proportional to the total distance from the agent to the fire across the region, fire_reward inversely proportional to the number of fires in the environment. We process these rewards with exponential function in order to normalize them with temperature parameter, then blend them to get a 'final_reward'. Depending on the task's exact requirements, you might want to adjust the weighting between the distance and the fire components.

```
In this reward function, we are encouraging the agent to go closer to the fire and decrease the amount of fire. We compute distance_reward inversely proportional to the total distance from the agent to the fire across the region, fire_reward inversely proportional to the number of fires in the environment. We process these rewards with exponential function in order to normalize them with temperature parameter, then blend them to get a 'final_reward'. Depending on the task's exact requirements, you might want to adjust the weighting between the distance and the fire components.

 You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: def compute_reward() -> Tuple[np.array, Dict[str, np.array]]:
    ...
    return reward, {}

The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Ensure the reward values are constrained into a range to prevent overflow
    (5) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

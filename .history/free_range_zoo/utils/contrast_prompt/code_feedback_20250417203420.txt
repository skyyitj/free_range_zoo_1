1. Compare results between good and bad policies step by step
2. Examine each metric individually to identify improvement opportunities
3. If total reward remains negative, rewrite the entire policy function
4. For unsatisfactory metrics, consider:
   a) Adjusting temperature scale or values
   b) Rewriting the policy component
   c) Adding or removing policy components
Output the revised policy function.

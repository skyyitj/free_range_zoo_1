These following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the policy function:

1. Rewards: This metric represents the average rewards accumulated by all agents.
It is a direct measure of the overall success of the agents' actions.
A higher value indicates better performance, as it suggests that
the agents are effectively achieving their objectives and maximizing their rewards.

Fire Intensity Change: This metric measures the average change in fire intensity per step.
It reflects the agents' ability to control and reduce the fire's severity. A higher value is preferable,
 as it indicates that the agents are successfully mitigating the fire's impact over time.

Used Suppressant: This metric tracks the average amount of suppressant used by the agents.
It is a measure of resource efficiency. A lower value is better, as it suggests that
the agents are using their resources timely judiciously and effectively to control the fire.

Suppressant Efficiencyï¼šIt is calculated as the ratio of the reduction in fire intensity to the amount of suppressant used.
A higher value is better.

Burning Number: This metric represents the average number of fires that remain unhandled by the agents.
A lower value is desirable.

Putout Number: his metric measures the average number of fires successfully extinguished by the agents.
A higher value is better.

Burnedout Number: This metric tracks the average number of fires that have burned out without being handled by the agents.
A lower value is preferable.

Steps: This metric indicates the average number of steps taken to complete the task.
A lower value is desirable.

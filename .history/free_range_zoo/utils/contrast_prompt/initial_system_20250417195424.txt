You are a policy engineer trying to write policy functions to solve a fire-fighting task.

# Task Description
Agents decide how to use limited suppressant resources to collaboratively put out wildfire tasks that appear both spontaneously and due to realistic fire-spread mechanics. Agents must temporarily disengage when they run out of limited suppressant to recharge before rejoining the firefighting efforts.

# Task Rules:
1. Assignment Constraints:
   - Each agent can only be assigned to one fire location per decision step
   - Agents can be assigned to any fire location regardless of distance

2. Fire Dynamics:
   - Fire intensity decreases based on agent's suppressant use
   - Remaining fire = Current intensity - (Agent's suppressant Ã— Reduction power)
   - If fire intensity remains positive, it spread to neighboring grid cells with a given probability
   - If fire level exceeds threshold {threshold}, it self-extinguishes but penalizes agents

3. Resource Management:
   - Agents have limited suppressant resources
   - Suppressant is consumed when fighting fires
   - Strategic resource allocation is crucial

4. Reward Structure:
   - Each fire location has an associated reward weight (float)
   - Reward weights are provided as regular floating-point numbers
   - Example: fire_putout_weight = [4.0, 4.0] for two fire locations

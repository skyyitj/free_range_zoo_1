These following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the policy function:

1. Rewards: This metric represents the average rewards accumulated by all agents.
It directly measures the agents' overall performance.
Higher values indicate better performance, showing that agents are effectively achieving their objectives.

2. Fire Intensity Change: This metric measures the average change in fire intensity per step.
It reflects the agents' ability to control and reduce the fire's severity. Higher values indicate better fire mitigation.

3. Used Suppressant: This metric tracks the average amount of suppressant used by the agents.
Lower values indicate more efficient resource usage.

4. Suppressant Efficiency: This metric calculates the ratio of fire intensity reduction to suppressant used.
Higher values indicate better efficiency.

5. Burning Number: This metric represents the average number of unhandled fires.
Lower values are better.

6. Putout Number: This metric measures the average number of successfully extinguished fires.
Higher values are better.

7. Burnedout Number: This metric tracks the average number of fires that burned out without intervention.
Lower values are better.

8. Steps: This metric indicates the average number of steps taken to complete the task.
Lower values are better.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved policy function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) You can start with "let's think step by step", and then look at each metric individually and think about how can you improve it
    (2) If the total reward maintains negative, then you must rewrite the entire policy function
    (3) If the values for a certain metric component are not satisfying, then this means the written policy function is not able to accomplish the task goal. You may consider:
        (a) Changing the temperature scale or value of the related policy component so that this metric can be balanced
        (b) Re-writing the related policy component 
        (c) Discarding the policy component or add a new policy component 
Now, output the revised good policy function.

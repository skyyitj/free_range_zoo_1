You are a policy engineer developing decision-making functions for firefighting agents in a wildfire simulation.

Task: Design policies for agents to effectively extinguish wildfires in a collaborative environment with the following characteristics:
- Fires appear spontaneously and spread according to realistic mechanics
- Agents have limited suppressant resources that require recharging
- Agents must temporarily disengage from firefighting when resources are depleted

Your goal is to create efficient policies that maximize firefighting effectiveness while managing resource constraints.

The function template is as follows: {policy_signature}. You can only modify the function body with inputs, not the function signature.

You are a policy engineer developing decision-making functions for firefighting agents in a wildfire simulation.

Task: Design policies for agents to effectively extinguish wildfires in a collaborative environment with the following characteristics:
- Fires appear spontaneously and spread according to realistic mechanics
- Agents have limited suppressant resources that require recharging
- Agents must temporarily disengage from firefighting when resources are depleted
- The environment uses a discrete action space (select specific actions, not continuous values)

Your goal is to create efficient policies that maximize firefighting effectiveness while managing resource constraints.

# Installation

In this guide we walk through installing [free-range-zoo](https://github.com/oasys-mas/free-range-zoo). For this we 
need a python virtual environment, here we use miniconda. The action/observation spaces in free-range-zoo rely on 
rust functions implemented in [free-range-rust](https://github.com/C4theBomb/free-range-rust) for efficency. Compiling 
these is part of the `poetry` install, so we will: 
 
1. Install gcc-13 / clang and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone  [free-range-zoo](https://github.com/oasys-mas/free-range-zoo)
3. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/)
4. Create a python **3.12** environment, we support no lower version
5. Install dependencies
6. Test

> We have experienced problems with installation in macOS computers which utilize x86_64 architectures. `pytorch` no 
longer supports x86 macOS.

## 1. Install gcc-13 / clang

1.1 Execute `gcc --version`

1.2 If `gcc --version` >= 13.0, install it (following below OS-specific instructions prior to 1.3 and 1.4)

1.3 Set the environment variables `export ...`
-  `CC="<path to your gcc v13 binary>"`
-  `CXX="<path to your g++ v13 binary>`

> `export` on linux, `edit system environment variables` on windows. On mac do the same but for llvm, you can try to update it with `brew` then use the mac path override from 1.mac.2

1.4 Make sure the version is correct
   - `gcc -v` = `13.x`

### Linux (GCC 13)

1.lin.1  Install gcc
   - If in **Ubuntu** `sudo apt install gcc-13`
   - for **fedora/rhel/CentOS** `sudo dnf install gcc-toolset-13`


### MacOS (Clang) - aarch64

1.mac.1 `brew install llvm@15`: Install clang 14/15

1.mac.2 Run the path override command that homebrew gives you when running this (this updates your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`).

### Windows (MinGW-w64)

1.win.1 Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

1.win.2 Install GCC/MinGW (in administrative powershell)
  - `choco install mingw` currently this gives the right version. You may have to specify version in the future.

1.win.3 Add `mingw` to path. 
  - Search for `environment variables` in the windows search bar. Click on "environment variables" Then click on `path` in the list. Click `edit`. See if there is a entry for `mingw` If not find the `mingw64\mingw64\bin` folder and add it to `path` (typically this is in `C:\ProgramData`).

1.win.4 Restart powershell

## 2. Rust

### Linux / MacOS
-   Go to [Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) select your os, and run the curl command.

### Windows
- `choco install rust`: Install Rust, restart machine to see effects.

### Verify install

- `rustc --version`: Verify that the RustC compiler was installed.

- `cargo --version`: Verify that cargo was properly installed.

> If `cargo --version` or `rustc --version` do not work, manually add `rust` to your path.

## 3.  Clone Free-Range-Zoo

- `git clone git@github.com:oasys-mas/free-range-zoo.git`: Clone the latest release of the free-range-zoo repository.

## 4.  Miniconda

> âš  WARNING: DO NOT USE SUDO HERE! IT IS VERY LIKELY TO BREAK INSTALL.

4.1 Run the installation script for [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/), select your os. 



4.2 Install with defaults, and say `yes` to the conda init question.

4.3 Restart your terminal

4.4 You should see something like `(base) user@machine:...` 

>If you don't then double check that the `miniconda3` folder is in your home directory and that it was added to your path.

## 5. Create Python env

5.1 `conda create -n three12 python=3.12`: Create a python 3.12 environment

5.2  `conda activate three12`: Activate the created python environment

## 6. Install Dependencies

6.1 `cd free-range-zoo` Navigate to the `free-range-zoo` git directory. 

6.2 `pip install poetry`: Install poetry, the dependency tool we use.

6.3 `poetry install`: Install all dependencies with poetry

## 7. Test

- `python -m unittest -b`: To see if everything is working try running our unit tests. This will build a local copy of 
our docs page, see `free-range-zoo/docs/build/html/index.html`.

### Windows

When on Windows, the unittest will not build the docs. To build them:

> If you are having trouble getting `free-range-rust` to install, and you still want to build the docs, run `pip install -e .` in the root of the `free-range-zoo` repository before doing this. Then **uninstall the frz library first before reattempting to install free-range-rust** `pip uninstall free-range-zoo`.

-  navigate to `free-range-zoo/docs`. 
-  Ensure you are on the `three12` conda environment
-  run  `python free_range_zoo_docs/gen_envs_docstrings.py`
-  run `python free_range_zoo_docs/gen_envs_mds.py`
-  run `make build`.
